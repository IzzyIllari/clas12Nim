\section{Code Management}
\label{sec:manage}

\subsection{Repositories}

The software is managed in a github repository~\cite{recon-github}, and branches and forks are utilized to
accommodate parallel development by several groups.  Two main branches, {\it master} and {\it development}, are
utilized to store code ready for production and for validation, respectively. For the main branches, all modifications
are made through pull requests after passing the automated tests described in Section~\ref{sec:tests} and require
approval by a designated software expert.

\subsection{Releases}

There are three reconstruction code release types: test release, validation release, and production release. A
numbering scheme has been implemented to indicate the type of change with respect to previous releases. Test
releases, identified by the letter ``c'', are tagged from branches other than the master and development branches
and are intended to validate a specific code change or algorithmic improvement. Usage of these releases is typically
limited to the developers. Validation releases, identified by the letter ``b'', are tagged from the development branch
to test code updates before merging to the master branch. Production releases are tagged from the master branch
after code updates for production data processing.

The release numbering scheme uses the format X(b/c).Y.Z, where increments of X, Y, or Z are applied in the
following cases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item X: introduction of new technology, major algorithmic improvements or changes that are not backward
  compatible;
  \item Y: extension of interfaces, new implementations or major bug fixes;
  \item Z: minor bug fixes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Tests and Validation}
\label{sec:tests}

In addition to automatic builds, the software includes both basic unit tests and advanced tests for several
packages. These are designed to verify the correctness and reproducibility of the reconstruction output for a
specific package or for the overall event, respectively. Unit tests involve, for example, reconstructing a simulated
track or particle hit in a specific detector and comparing the result to the true information. Advanced and extended
tests are run on either a simulation or real data sample, comparing to the true information in the first case or to the
results obtained in previous releases in the second case. A portion of the tests are run automatically at build time,
using the TravisCI system linked to the github repository.  These automatic tests take about 30 minutes to run and
have proven invaluable in overseeing software development.

In addition to unit and advanced tests, every new release is subject to extensive validation on both simulated and
real data. Samples of Monte Carlo and real events for different beam energies and detector configurations were
chosen to test event reconstruction over the whole detector acceptance. Reconstruction of these samples is
performed and results are compared to previous code releases. The comparison focuses on several parameters, from
processing time, to momentum resolution, to particle reconstruction efficiency. A new release is accepted for
production only if it results in globally improved performance.
