\subsection{RICH Detector}

The goal of the RICH reconstruction is to provide a Cherenkov angle estimate for each detected photon and intercepted hadron track, to allow subsequent detailed likelihood particle identification algorithms~\cite{rich-nim}. The CLAS12 tracking system defines the trajectory of the hadron track inside the detector, in particular position and angle within the aerogel radiator, and impact point on the \MaPMT plane (if any). In the preliminary phase, the RICH reconstruction identified the cluster of hits produced by the charged particle in the sensor plane. The cross-talk signals are identified by means of an amplitude analysis (based on the time-over-threshold information) in conjunction with geometrical constraints, taking into account that a cross-talk hit should be in the proximity of a genuine hit. Hits neither belonging to a cluster nor flagged as cross-talk are considered Cherenkov photon candidates. 

The photon path inside the RICH is reconstructed in two complementary ways, taking the middle point of the hadron trajectory inside the radiator as the emission point, and the hit pixel coordinates as detection point. The first method uses an analytic formula that takes into account the refraction at the aerogel face and is only valid for directly detected photons. It provides an exact solution. The second method uses a ray tracing algorithm that takes into account also the mirror reflections. It provides a numeric solution based on a iterative procedure. Both methods return the reconstructed Cherenkov angle in conjunction with the corresponding aerogel refractive index. The latest can slightly vary with respect the nominal value due to the chromatic dependence on the unknown photon energy.

The relevant RICH components (aerogel, mirrors, \MaPMT plane) are converted into ray-tracing planes or spheres where the photon can undergo refraction, reflection or detection. Each ray-tracing element can be independently aligned. The alignment procedure uses as a benchmark the Cherenkov signal generated by electrons, as identified by CLAS12 sub-detectors other than RICH. For these particles, the expected Cherenkov angle is given by the known particle momentum and mass. The position and orientation of the \MaPMT plane is defined by minimizing the average distance matching the RICH clusters to the charged tracks extrapolated to the \MaPMT plane. Any other RICH component can be aligned with respect to the \MaPMT plane by selecting the sub-sample of photons passing through that component. The alignment is made by minimizing the average distance between the ray-traced detection point (RdP) and the corresponding measured \MaPMT hit over the selected sub-sample of photons.

For each hadron track, the ray-tracing algorithm progresses as described in the following. A trial photon is a hypothetical photon assumed to originate from the emission point at a Cherenkov angle $\theta_T$, and at an azimuthal angle $\phi_T$, with the corresponding RdP $T(\theta_T, \phi_T)$ defined by the ray-tracing algorithm. A limited ensemble (of the order of 100) of trials is initially traced having $\theta_T$ defined by a particle hypothesis, i.e. electron for a particle identified as electron in CLAS12, pion otherwise, and $\phi_T$ uniformly distributed around the charged particle trajectory, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:RayShow}.. For each \MaPMT measured hit, the closest trial RdP is taken to be the starting point of the iterative ray-tracing procedure for that hit. To initiate the iterative procedure, the closest trial RdP is required to stays at a distance from the hit smaller than 10 cm, that is twice the typical distance between the initial trial RdPs on the \MaPMT plane.
 At each step, the closest trial is re-traced by varying its angles by the expected Cherenkov angle resolution $\sigma$ to define the corresponding displaced RdPs $T_{\theta} (\theta_T + \sigma, \phi_T)$ and $T_{\phi}(\theta_T, \phi_T + \sigma)$. The distance vectors $\vv{TT_\theta}$ and $\vv{TT_\phi}$, connecting each rotated trial RdP to the initial trial RdP, naturally define a reference system in the \MaPMT plane, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:RayAlgo}. The distance vector $\vv{TH}$ between the measured hit $H$ and the closest trial RdP position $T$ is projected onto the reference vectors to get an estimate of the next angular step. In particular, the scale factor $f$ of the polar angle step $\Delta \theta = f \sigma$ is defined by projecting the distance vector $\vv{TH}$ onto the reference vector $\vv{TT_\theta}$: $f=(\vv{TH}\cdot \vv{TT_\theta}) / |\vv{TT_\theta}|^2$. The factor $f$ can be either positive or negative, depending if the rotated point moves toward or backward to the measured hit.  The same is done for the azimuthal angle $\phi$.

The dashed lines show examples of the ray-traced photon paths from the common emission point (in the radiator) to the detected hit: two direct photons emitted upwards, two reflected photons emitted downwards. Open circles are the RICH detected hits. The circles are filled in the case that a viable traced solution has been found. The central cluster is generated by the track impact on the MaPMT plane.}

\caption{Example of iteration of the ray-tracing photon path reconstruction. The emission polar $\theta_T$ and azimuthal $\phi_T$ angles of the closest trial photon are varied by the expected Cherenkov angle resolution $\sigma$ to extrapolate the corresponding displacements of the detection point. The distance between the measured hit and the trial is projected onto such displacements to quantify the next angular step in units of $\sigma$.}

The angles of the trial photon are modified by such calculated $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$ angular shifts, and the procedure repeated. At each step the trial RdP gets closer to the measured hit, but an exact solution can not be found as the procedure uses a linear approximation relating the distances in the \MaPMT plane with the angular rotations in the 3D space. The iterative procedure stops when the distance of the trial RdP from the measured hit is smaller than a fraction of the \MaPMT pixel size, i.e. the RICH detector spatial resolution. The converge is fast, typically within few steps, so that the average reconstruction time of a RICH event is negligible for CLAS12, at the level of few tens of microseconds.

For each photon hit in the event, the RICH reconstruction procedure provides a measurement of the Cherenkov angle that does not depend on a given particle hypothesis, having as only inputs the emission point, the hit position and the detector geometry. The initial particle hypothesis is only instrumental to define the starting ensemble of trials. As soon as a trial closer than 10 cm to the hit is found, the iterative procedure re-calculate the angles using only geometrical information and neglecting any previous assumption on the particle type.

As there is no a priori knowledge on which particle has emitted a given photon, the procedure is repeated for any charged particle intercepting the RICH radiator. The ensemble of such measured Cherenkov angles represents the basic experimental information provided by the RICH. Any particle identification method, from the most simple average at track level to the most complicated likelihood using the whole event information, can be derived from it.
