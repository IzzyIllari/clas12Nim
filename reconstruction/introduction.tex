\section{Introduction}

The CLAS12 offline reconstruction and analysis application consist of a framework to process data,
software tools that provide data and database access, as well as functionality to manipulate and
analyze it, and reconstruction packages.  Each reconstruction package is written to extract
the information needed to reconstruct events taking into account the entire detector system.
The reconstruction software components are deployed in the reconstruction platform described
in the next section.
