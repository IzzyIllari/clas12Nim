\section{Overview}





simulations overview description, how geometry and digitization and calibration constants are loaded.

\subsection{Event Time Window}
\subsection{Hit Definition}
\subsection{True Information}
Process ID.


Then we go to each detector

- geometry (git location), description
- calibration constants
- digitization (with git location and time window)
- Process Identifier
