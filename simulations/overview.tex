\section{Overview}

The CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer for operation at 12 GeV beam energy (CLAS12) \cite{overview2019}  at Jefferson Laboratory was designed to study
electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of charged and neutral particles over a large
fraction of the full solid angle. The spectrometer have met the performance criteria of instantaneous luminosity up
to $10^35$ cm$^{-2}$s$^-1$ and momentums resolution in the forward direction using drift chambers and in the central
direction using vertex tracker $< 1\%$ and $< 3\%$, respectively.

The CLAS12 collaboration has implemented a detector simulation within the GEMC software framework \cite{gemc2019}.
During the design phase of the various CLAS12 detectors, shielding, magnets, and passive elements, GEMC allowed studying the
performance of the various components with respect to the desired science objectives. GEMC enabled the optimization of the design
thanks to trade-off studies between variation of the hardware setup and placement, various material and shielding thicknesses.
In addition, it was instrumental in determining the rates, PMTs currents and radiation doses to ensure the various detectors
survived the operations during the spectrometer lifetime. Before and during the experiment data taking GEMC helped prepare
and understand the calibration and measurements of the CLAS12 detectors. Finally, GEMC is used to accurately calculate the
CLAS12 acceptance, including detector response, geometrical acceptance, tracking efficiency, needed for the physics results
and science goals.


GEMC is a c++ framework that uses Geant4 \cite{geant4} to simulate the passage of particles through matter. It provides:
\begin{itemize}
	\item an application-independent geometry description
	\item an easy interface to build / run experiments
	\item CAD/GDML imports
\end{itemize}

The simulation parameters are stored in external databases and are used to define the Geant4 objects at run time. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item geometry
	\item materials
	\item mirrors
	\item physics list
	\item database constants
	\item digitization
	\item electromagnetic fields
\end{itemize}

Particles are transported through the detector materials and produce radiation, hits, and secondaries.
GEMC then collects the Geant4 results and produces the output specified by the user.
The design of the framework is summarized in \F{gemcDesign}.

	\caption{The architecture of GEMC. The simulation parameters are stored in an external database. GEMC collects
             them and organize the necessary Geant4 ingredients used to simulate the
             passage of particles through materials and sensitive regions. The hits are digitized with
             plugins defined by the user and collected in user-defined outputs.  }

\end{figure}



\subsection{Geometry and Materials Import}

The geometry and system materials are stored in external databases that can be MYSQL tables or text files that mimic the MYSQL tables.
The databases can be defined using the following factories:

\begin{itemize}
	\item GEMC native API (Perl or Python)
	\item java algorithms used by both simulation and the CLAS12 Event Reconstruction Software \cite{reco2019}, or ``java geometry services''
	\item CAD (stl, ply, obj formats)
	\item GDML, c++ plugins (not used in CLAS12)
\end{itemize}

The GEMC native API repository is \url{https://github.com/gemc/api}. The geometry service code repository is
\url{https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software/blob/development/common-tools/clas-jcsg/src/main/java/org/jlab/detector/geant4/v2/}


\subsubsection{Geometry database using native API or geometry service}

An example of the code to define and store a Geant4 volume in an external database is shown below. The
numbers come typically from a calibration database or are defined in the geometry service. The material
has a similar interface.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Perl]
my %detector = init_det();

$d{"name"}       = "shield";
$d{"mother"}     = "root";
$d{"descr"}      = "bst";
$d{"color"}      = "88aaff";
$d{"pos"}        = "0*cm 1*cm 2*cm" ;
$d{"material"}   = "G4_W";
$d{"type"}       = "Box";
$d{"dimensions"} = "1*mm 2*mm 3*mm ";
$d{"visible"}    = 1;
$d{"style"}      = 1;
print_det(\%configuration, \%d);

\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Importing CAD volumes from the engineering model}

The Hall B detectors and their supports are designed with 3D CAD software. This includes a reference system and the
hierarchy of all detector elements, down to details like nuts and bolts.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/cadSelection.png}
	\caption{The engineering model of one of the CLAS12 detectors, before importing it into GEMC.
             The model may be composed by thousands of elements, not all of them relevant to the the GEMC Geant4 simulation.
             The import process involves filtering out unnecessary volumes that are not in the active region.}
	\label{fig:cadSelection}
\end{figure}

The CAD models are exported into STP files \cite{stepFiles}.
In order to import them into a Geant4 simulation, the volumes relevant to the simulation are selected from the engineering
model stored in one of the CAD data exchange format (typically a STEP file) \cite{cadExchange}, see \F{cadSelection}.


The elements in the STP file are then ``tessellated'', in which polygonal shapes are created to define a Geant4 volume
that best represent the original CAD element.
The software used to do this is FreeCad \cite{freeCad}. An example of tessellation showing the polygonal shapes
is shown in \F{targetScatteringChamber}.

The simulated CAD import is as close to reality as the engineering model is close to reality.
We did encounter differences between the STP files, the drawings, and reality in a few occasions and designed
a workflow to eliminate any discrepancies.
An example of the CAD validation is shown in \F{cadValidationExample}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/targetScatteringChamber.png}
	\caption{An example of a volume from an STP file tessellated in GEMC. The volume that is shown is the target scattering chamber.
            Top: the CAD representation in the engineering model. Bottom: the tessellation. }
	\label{fig:targetScatteringChamber}
\end{figure}


%\begin{figure}

%	\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/cadValidation.png}
%	\caption{There are four possible representation of a volume: the one coming from the STP file
%            and the tessellated one are exactly the same object (within the tessellation precision).
%             In some cases, certain elements and their sizes and positions did not match the drawings.
%             In other cases, they did not match what was built and measured, or their position did not
%             match the survey. To eliminate these occurrences physicists and engineers worked until
%             the final iteration of a volume was the same in all 4 models: STP/GEMC, Drawings and Reality}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/cadValidationExample.png}
	\caption{An example of comparing volumes in the GEMC simulation to the engineering drawings, in this case to validate the cone shield
             position. Top: engineering drawings of the CLAS12 beamline and shielding. The start of the M\"oller shielding is 87.77 cm downstream
             of the target center. Bottom: a geantino (a special Geant4 particle that does not interact with materials or fields)
             is shot vertically at z=87.77 cm, showing that the Geant4 cone position agrees with the drawings.}
	\label{fig:cadValidationExample}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Magnetic Fields}
The magnetic fields are loaded from ascii files. The following Geant4 parameters are loaded from
command line options or configuration files at run time:

\begin{itemize}
	\item minStep: minimum track distance in the magnetic field (step) before re-computing its value
	\item integralAlgorithm: compute the field value from the closest cell or using a linear (or bi-linear) interpolation
	\item interpolationMethod: interpolation algorithm used to transport tracks in magnetic fields, typically
		  a variation (choice of order and/or precision) of Runge Kutta \cite{rungeKutta} methods
\end{itemize}

The implementation of the CLAS12 magnetic fields is described in Section \ref{clas12FieldMaps}.

\subsection{Event Time Window and Hit Definition}

The Geant4 sensitive volumes are associated with a GEMC identifier that contains hierarchical information such as mother volumes
and volume copy number.

Each detector is associated with a time quantity to mimic the readout electronic time window. The time window and identifier
define a GEMC hit from a series of Geant4 steps: all the steps in a given identifier that are within the time window
are part of the same GEMC hit. The algorithm is illustrated in \F{hitDefinition}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/hitDefinition.png}
	\caption{The GEMC Hit Definition algorithm. The sensitive element Cell 2 is hit by three particles, two primaries and one secondary.
             The Geant4 steps are drawn explicitly with circle and triangle symbols. The circle steps generated by both the primary track 1 and the secondary
             from track 2 are within the time window and therefore are part of the same GEMC hit ``Cell 2, Hit 1''.
             The single triangle step generated by the secondary from track 2 comes after and does not fall within the ``Cell 2, Hit 1``
             time window, therefore it is part of a new GEMC hit, ``Cell 2, Hit 2''.}
	\label{fig:hitDefinition}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Process ID}

A ``processID'' method can be implemented by some digitization algorithm to modify or add GEMC identifiers to each Geant4 step. For CLAS12 this happens in two
cases, detailed for each detector:

\begin{itemize}
	\item a paddle is hit but two outputs are produced because there is one PMT at each end of the scintillator. This
          is the case for CTOF, CND, and FTOF.
    \item some hardware elements are not present in the simulation. This is the case for the drift chambers, where the volumes do not contain
          the individual wires. In this case the wire id is calculated based on the position of the hit in the mother volume. In CLAS12 this mechanism
          is adopted by the DC, SVT and Micromegas.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Detectors and Hit Process Plugin Mechanism}

The detectors are associated with c++ digitization routines at run time, see \F{pluginsAssociation}.
This allows the routines to be developed independently from the core code. Abstract methods can be derived in
the individual detector hit processes to define the treatment of the Geant4 steps within the detector
time window to provide three kind of outputs:

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/pluginsAssociation.png}
	\caption{Hit process digitization plugin association. The detectors are associated by name with the hit process routine
             plugins at GEMC run time. The routines are registered in the hit process map and are called during digitization.}
	\label{fig:pluginsAssociation}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
	\item a bank with digitized variables for each hit;
	\item a bank with digitized variables for each Geant4 step;
	\item a bank with an analog voltage versus time signal for each Geant4 hit.
\end{itemize}

The digitized banks are detailed in each detector subsystem, for example in section \ref{tab:bstBank}.

\subsection{``Truth'' Information}

The true information is saved in the output when requested, per detector. The true information can
be integrated (one variable entry per GEMC hit) or verbose (one variable entry per Geant4 step).
The true information variables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:trueInformation}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\small
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
			\hline \hline
			Variable    & Description  \\
			\hline
				pid         &   ID of the FP                     \\
				mpid        &   ID of the mother of the FP \\
				tid         &   Track ID of the FP\\
				mtid        &   Track ID of the mother of the FP  \\

				avg\_z      &   Average $z$ position  \\
				avg\_lx     &   Average local $x$ position \\
				avg\_ly     &   Average local $y$ position \\

				mvy         &   $y$  of the FP mother's origin \\
				mvz         &   $z$  of the FP mother's origin \\
				avg\_t      &   Average time \\
				nsteps      &   Number of Geant4 steps \\
				procID      &   Process that created the FP.  \\
				hitn        &   Hit ID \\
			\hline \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The true information bank. Quantities like totEdep integrates the information within one hit, but some
             variables only record the First Particle (FP) entering the sensitive volume.}\label{tab:trueInformation}
\end{table}


\subsection{Database Constants}

The mechanism to read, store, and make available the CCDB \cite{ccdb} calibration constants is
executed at the start of the run and every time the run number changes.
Individual detector add their constants by implementing the corresponding abstract method.
The list of constants loaded is detailed in each detector implementation section below.

\subsection{Digitization}

The digitization routines are called at the end of each event, after the Geant4 navigation
has propagated all tracks and GEMC has collected all the steps into hits.

The process routines digitize each hit by iterating through all the steps in it and collecting
a number of variables into detector banks. This typically involves calculating a charge based
on energy deposited and converting it into an ADC number, calculating a hit time based
on various signal propagation models and converting that time into TDC, convertng a number
of collected photons into charge and then ADC, etc. It is at this stage that the calibration
constants are used (for example, attenuation length in scintillator paddles).

There are four different types of digitization, each with a different output structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item integrated (one bank per hit): this is implemented for all CLAS12 detectors;
	\item step-by-step (one bank per Geant4 step): used for debugging;
	\item voltage: the analog signal versus time calculated as a response of the detector to tracks passing through it;
	\item fadc: the same FADC bank from crate/slot/channel as written by the CLAS12 data acquisition system \cite{daq2019}.
          This is implemented for the CND, CTOF, FTOF, FT-CAL, ECAL.
\end{itemize}


The digitization is detailed in each detector implementation section.


\subsection{Output}

The GEMC output is available in two formats, identical in content: text (ascii) and evio \cite{evio}, the Jefferson Lab
data acquisition format.
Utilities were used to convert the evio format onto ROOT \cite{root}.

The various output banks include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item header: timestamp, event number, run number, etc.
	\item generated: generated particle information as seen by Geant4. This bank includes summarized information of the interaction of
                     the particles with each detector such as the number of hits, total energy deposited, etc. This summary includes
                     the interactions of all the primary particle secondaries.
	\item generator extras: information stored in the generated file, not necessary used in Geant4, for example cross sections, weights, etc.
	\item beam radio-frequency signal: mimics the accelerator bank, a 248 MHz signal
	\item detector true info, per hit or per step
	\item detector digitized info, per hit or per step
	\item detector voltage vs. time
	\item detector fadc signal
	\item ancestors: the complete hierarchy of the primary and secondary particles
\end{itemize}

The various banks are organized using a unique integer identifier.

\subsection{Background Merging}

Real data can be merged with simulated events, typically from random trigger data to emulate physics and electronic background in
the various detectors.
The data is un\-digitized using the inverse digitization to calculate the energy and real timing from the ADC and TDC values.
It is then saved in text files indexed by event number and detector ID. This also makes it possible to scale the background luminosity by grouping
several events into one; for example, grouping two events at 50 nA beam current give one event with background from 100 nA current.
The energy information is re-digitized using the same algorithm used for the Geant4 steps, producing additional hits to the ones coming from simulation.



\section{CLAS12 Geometry Implementation}

The following sections describe the implementation of the individual CLAS12 components into the simulation.
