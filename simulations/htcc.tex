\subsection{High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC)}

The HTCC geometry is implemented through the native GEMC geometry API. The elliptical mirrors are subtractions of
ellipsoid Geant4 volumes along certain planes between two adjacent mirror substrates. Each plane is defined by a
second-order curve along which the two substrates intersect. They are contained inside an HTCC mother volume made
with a Geant4 ``polycone'' (see \F{htccGeometry}). The faces of the PMTs are the sensitive volumes, associated with the
quartz-glass material and with the HTCC digitization routine.

The refractive index of the CO$_2$ radiator gas and its transparency is included in the material optical properties and
taken into account during the Geant4 transportation of the photons. The same is true for the reflectivity of the mirrors
and Winston cones. Finally, the quantum efficiency associated with the PMT photo-cathode is taken into account in
the digitization routine.

          PMTs.}

\subsubsection{Digitization}

Photons that impinge on the PMT faces are processed with the digitization routine. Each photon collected is input to the
quantum efficiency algorithm at its wavelength to decide if it is finally detected.

The time average of all the photons is saved in the output after a time shift coming from the calibration database.
The digitized output bank variables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:htccBank}.

			Variable  & Description                         \\

             half     &                     half-sector     \\
             nphe     &        number of photo-electrons     \\
             time     &         average time of the hit     \\
             hitn     &                      hit number     \\
			\hline \hline

\end{table}

The time window  of the HTCC is set to 5~ns: all Geant4 steps within the same PMT and time window are collected in one hit.
