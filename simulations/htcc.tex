\section{High Threshold Cerenkov Counter (HTCC)}

\subsection{Geometry}

The CND geometry is implemented through the native gemc geometry API. The elliptical mirrors are made through a subtraction of
two G4Ellipsoid. They are contained inside an HTCC mother volume made with a G4Polycone. The faces of the PMT are the sensitive volumes,
associated with the quartz-glass material and associated with the htcc digitization routine.

The mirror and winston cones reflectivities and the pmts quantum efficiencies are associated with the mirror and the pmt faces optical
properties and are taken into account in the digitization routine.
