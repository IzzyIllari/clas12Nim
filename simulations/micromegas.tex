\section{Barrel Micromegas Tracker (BMT)}

\subsection{Geometry}

The Micromegas geometry is implemented through the native GEMC geometry API.
There are three micromegas regions, divided azimuthally in three identical sectors. Each sector contain a cover layer with copper ground,
the PCB with the readout strips, the kapton support, the mesh layer and the ionizing gas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item -- overlay
	\item ---- copper ground
	\item ------ pcb
	\item -------- strips
	\item ---------- kapton
	\item ------------ gas
	\item -------------- mesh
\end{itemize}

The sensitive volume containing the gas is assigned the argon isobutan gas and associated with the BMT hit process routine.
The geometry is summarized in \F{bmtGeometry}

The strip identification is performed in the Process ID routine.

\subsubsection{Geometry Git Location}
The Github location of the GEMC perl API script is \url{https://github.com/gemc/detectors/tree/master/clas12/micromegas}.


\subsection{Process ID}
At each Geant4 step, the local coordinate in the sensor volume are used to calculate the strip id.
The algorithm includes the lorentz angle based on the magnetic field strength, the angula, pitch between the strips,
the dead zones of the sensitive parts. A virtual electron avalanche is simulated based the energy deposited. The avalanche
is deposited onto one strip or distributed among several to account for the energy sharing.



\subsection{Digitization}

\subsubsection{ADC}
The Micromegas digitization provides the ADC value calculated using the total energy deposited (after hit sharing).


\subsubsection{TDC}
There is no timing information in the output.
