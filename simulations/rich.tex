\subsection{Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH)}

One of the six CLAS12 Forward Carriage sectors has been equipped with a Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector \cite{rich-nim}.

The RICH mirror geometry is implemented through both the native GEMC geometry API and imports from the engineering
model STEP files. The spherical mirrors are made through Geant4 boolean intersections of spheres and planes.
Since the array of 391 PMTs is inside the CLAS12 acceptance, particular care went into implementing in the
simulation the details of the PMT hardware and materials: the PMTs are Geant4 aluminum boxes containing the
electronics components materials (accounting for the adapter, the  Multi Anode Read Out Chip, and FPGA boards),
the window, and the photo-cathodes.
Each multi-anode PMT contains 64 pixels. The identification of the pixel is done in the process identification routine.
The aerogel radiator tiles are imported from the engineering CAD models and include the triangular, squared, pentagonal,
and trapezoidal shapes. The RICH box, mirror support structure, tiles wrapping, planar mirrors, and additional
support hardware are also imported from the engineering CAD models.
\F{richGeometry} shows details of the geometry implementation.

             Cherenkov light cone.
			 Part of the cone reflects onto the spherical mirror and into the PMT array. The remaining photons go
             through the aerogel tiles
			 and bounce off the planar mirror onto the PMT array. All inefficiencies are taken into account
             by using the aerogel refractive index
			 and its transparency. }

\end{figure}

The refractive index and transparency was measured for each aerogel tile, and is included in the simulation by
assigning a unique material to each aerogel volume with the proper optical properties, as is
the reflectivity of each of the spherical and planar mirrors.
The quantum efficiency associated with the PMT photo-cathodes is taken into account in the digitization routine.

\subsubsection{Process ID}
At each Geant4 step, the local coordinates in the PMT volume are used to calculate the pixel number within that PMT.

\subsubsection{Digitization}

Photons that impinge on the PMT faces are processed with the digitization routine.
Each photon collected is input to the quantum efficiency algorithm at its wavelength to decide if it is detected.
The total number of photo-electrons is then calculated based on the PMT gains and calibrated response.
Finally, algorithms based on calibration parameters from CCDB are used to determine the leading and
trailing edge times, which are then converted to TDCs.
The digitized output bank variables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:richBank}.

The time window  of the RICH is set to 300 ns: all Geant4 steps within the same PMT pixel and time window are collected in one hit.
