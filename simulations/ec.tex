\section{Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EC) and pre-shower calorimeter (PCAL)}

\subsection{Geometry}

Both EC and PCAL calorimeters geometry is implemented through the COATJAVA geometry service.
The service provides the geant4 definitions that are read by the GEMC perl api to build the geometry database.

All scintillators are geant4 volumes. The paddles are assigned the scintillator material and associated with the ftof hit process routine.
Each scintillator is a G4Trap embedded in a G4Trapezoid mother volume made of air, see \F{ecGeometry} and  \F{pcalGeometry}.

            The paddles are G4Boxes, embedded in trapezoid representing the mother volumes of each panel.
            The paddles layers are alternating with trapezoid made of lead, for a sampling fraction of about 0.3.

ec and pcal respectively.



\subsection{Digitization}
The digitization is the same for both the EC and the PCAL calorimeters.

\subsubsection{ADC}

The energy deposited is reduced based on the position on the paddle using the calibration attenuation length.
A number of photoelectrons is generated using a poissonian distributuion based on the attenuated energy.
After a paddle resolution $\sigma_{res}$ is calculated from the calibration constants, fluctuations in PMT gain
are taking into account using a Gaussian form with $\sigma_{res}$. A conversion factor is used to produce an ADC output.

\subsubsection{TDC}
The absolute hit time is corrected using the attenuation length and an additional factor accounts for the time-walk correction.
