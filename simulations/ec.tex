\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EC) and Pre-Shower Calorimeter (PCAL)}

Both the EC and PCAL (referred to together as ECAL) calorimeter geometry is implemented through the JAVA
geometry service. The service provides the Geant4 definitions that are read by the GEMC PERL API to build the
geometry database.

Each scintillator is a separate Geant4 volume. The paddles are assigned the scintillator material and associated with
the ECAL hit process routine. Each scintillator is a trapezoid embedded in a trapezoidal mother volume made of air
(see \F{ecGeometry}).

\subsubsection{Digitization}

The digitization is the same for both the EC and the PCAL calorimeters. The energy deposited is reduced based on the
position on the scintillator using the calibrated light attenuation length. The number of photons $N_\gamma$ produced
in the scintillator is derived from this energy using a Poissonian distribution. $N_\gamma$ is then smeared using the
scintillator resolution $\sigma_{res}$ estimated from the data. Fluctuations in the PMT gains, also estimated from data,
are also applied to $N_\gamma$ and a conversion factor is used to produce an ADC output.

The absolute hit time is corrected using the light attenuation length and an additional factor that accounts for the
time-walk correction. The digitized output bank variables for both systems are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ecBank}.

\end{table}

The time window of both the PCAL and EC is set to 400~ns: all Geant4 steps within the same paddle
and time window are collected in one hit.
