The Geant4 Monte-Carlo (GEMC) package is used simulate the passage of particles thrugh the various CLAS12 detectors.
The CLAS12 geometry is implemented through a database of geant4 volumes created through the program API or by the CLAS12
COATJAVA geometry service. Several hardware components are imported from the CAD engineering model.
The true inormation is digitized by routines specific to each detectors and include the use of the CLAS12 CCDB
calibration constants to produce both ADC and Flash ADC (FADC) response functions.
Theoretical models producing generated events interface with GEMC through the LUND format.
The merging of simulated data with real random trigger data provides a mechanism to includes both beam
and electronic background into the simulation of generated events.
