\subsection{Target}

The CLAS12 target components are imported from the engineering model. The STEP files are converted to tessellated STL files and imported
in the GEMC simulation \cite{targetCorrection}, \cite{targetStudy}. An example of the tessellation is shown in \F{targetScatteringChamber}.

Key elements of the STL import include the torlon tube to the target cell,
the target aluminum windows, the Kapton walls, and the scattering chamber, see \F{targetDesign}.
An overview of the target in Geant4 and the engineering model is shown in \F{targetOverview}.
