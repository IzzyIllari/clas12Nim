\subsection{Target}

The CLAS12 target components are imported from the engineering model. The STEP files are converted to tessellated
STL files and imported in the GEMC simulation~\cite{targetCorrection, targetStudy}. An example of the tessellation is
shown in \F{targetScatteringChamber}.

Key elements of the STL import include the Torlon tube to the target cell,
the target aluminum windows, the Kapton walls, and the scattering chamber (see \F{targetDesign}).
An overview of the target in Geant4 and the engineering model is shown in \F{targetOverview}.
