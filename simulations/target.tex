\section{Target}

The CLAS12 target components are imported from the engineering model. The STEP files are converted to tessellated STL files and imported
in the GEMC simulation \cite{targetCorrection}, \cite{targetStudy}.

An example of the tessellation is shown in \F{targetScatteringChamber}.

            Top: the CAD representation in the engineering model. Bottom: the tessellation. }

\end{figure}

Key elements of the STL import include the torlon tube to the target cell,
the target aluminum windows and kapton walls and the scattering chamber, see \F{targetDesign}.
