\section{Barrel Silicon Vertex Tracker (BST)}


\subsection{Geometry}


The BST geometry is implemented through the COATJAVA geometry service.
The service provides the geant4 definitions that are read by the GEMC perl api to build the geometry database.

There are three BST regions, with 10, 14 and 18 sectors for region 1, 2, and 3 respectively, see \F{bstGeometry}.
Each sectors contains a module with three sensors, two readout chips, and several layers of material,
including (length of line represents depth level):

\begin{itemize}
	\item -- wirebond
	\item ---- silicon
	\item ------ epoxy
	\item -------- rail
	\item ---------- bus cable
	\item ------------ carbon fiber
	\item -------------- rohacell
	\item ------------ carbon fiber
	\item ---------- bus cable
	\item -------- rail
	\item ------ epoxy
	\item ---- silicon
	\item -- wirebond
\end{itemize}

The strip identification is performed in the Process ID routine.

           in cyan color. The red track is a 2 GeV proton, leaving hits in each module crossed. Bottom: detail of a module shows
           the various material inside. The $300 \mu m$ silicon sensor is on top and bottom of the module.
           The material inside includes epoxy glue, the bus cable and support material. }

\subsubsection{Geometry Git Location}
The github location of the gemc perl api script is \url{https://github.com/gemc/detectors/tree/master/clas12/bst}.
The geometry service definitions in coatjava is \url{https://github.com/JeffersonLab/clas12-offline-software/blob/development/common-tools/clas-jcsg/src/main/java/org/jlab/detector/geant4/v2/SVTGeant4Factory.java}


\subsection{Process ID}

At each geant4 step, the local coordinate in the sensor volume are used to calculate the strip id.
The algorithm includes the dead zone around the sensor, the pitch between the strips ($156 \mu m$) and the angle
between the strips, that varies from 0 (strip n. 1) and 3 degrees (for strip n. 256). A showcase of the strip id assignment
is summarized in \F{processID}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/bstHit.png}
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/bstStrip.png}
	\caption{Top: process ID algorithm cartoon for BST. The strip ID is assigned based on the local position of the track
            step within the sensitive module. If a step of a primary or a secondary particle happens between the boundary
            of strip that was already hit, it will be assigned to that strip. Bottom: actual hit position of selected
            strips in the top and bottom silicon sensors of a module shows the fan-like distribution of the strips,
            with increasing angle. The top layer angle is the opposite of the bottom layer angle. }

Due to the thickness of the silicon sensor, the electrons avalanche produced can end up in more than one strip. This
is reproduced in the GEMC simulation using the hit sharing algorithm described in \F{bstHitSharing}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/bstHitSharing.png}
	\caption{The BST hit sharing algorithm. If a step in a given strip happens within $39 \mu m$ of another strip, then
            $90\%$ of the energy deposited will be shared equally between them ($45\%$ each), with a $10\%$ energy loss due
	         to capacitance between strip and backplane.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Digitization}

\subsubsection{ADC}
The BST digitization provides a 3 bit ADC, using the total energy deposited (after hit sharing) between 26 and 117 KeV.

\subsubsection{TDC}
There is no time associated with the hit, but a BCO quantity is provided to reproduce the BST.

\subsection{Digitized Bank}
The digitized output bank has $ID=100$, and the variables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:bstBank}
