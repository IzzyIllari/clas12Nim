\subsection{Solenoid and Torus Magnets}

The solenoid magnet geometry is produced with the GEMC PERL API. The solenoid is a single Geant4 polycone volume,
shown in \F{solenoid}.

          left.}

\end{figure}

The torus magnet geometry is imported from the engineering CAD model through 54 tessellated volumes. Among the
volumes are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the bore heat shield and hub components;
	\item the back and front hub steel plates;
	\item the stainless steel coil vacuum jackets;
	\item the torus coils containing the conductors, represented by copper volumes in Geant4;
	\item internal shielding around the hub, made by tungsten cylinders (blue in \F{torus}).
\end{itemize}

The torus hub is protected from the beam pipe background with additional tungsten shielding. The torus geometry is
shown in \F{torus}.

\subsubsection{Magnetic Field Maps}
\label{sec:clas12FieldMaps}

The CLAS12 torus and solenoid field maps are imported into the simulation using ASCII files. Both fields can be scaled
by an arbitrary factor. Both fields are defined in the Hall-B coordinate system and both can be shifted and tilted by
additional small amounts.

\subsubsection{Solenoid}

The solenoid field map has cylindrical symmetry around the $z$-axis (beamline), so the map used in the simulation is
defined in the transverse/longitudinal plane and then rotated when requested by the Geant4 navigation. The integration
method used in the simulation is the fourth-order Runge-Kutta technique~\cite{rungeKutta}.

The field map grid size is based on measured field variations and uniformity. The grid is made by 600 points in the
transverse coordinate, from 0 to 3~m and by 1200 points along the $z$-axis, from -3~m to 3~m. The field grid values
are linearly interpolated to the $(x,y,z)$ coordinate requested by Geant4. Table~\ref{tab:solMap} shows the field map
ASCII data structure. The simulation of one event in a 250~ns time window at the CLAS12 luminosity with and without
solenoid magnetic field is presented in \F{solenoidONOFF}, showing the effectiveness of the solenoid in providing
electromagnetic shielding of M\o ller electrons.

          beamline, providing an effective electromagnetic shield for CLAS12.}

\subsubsection{Torus}

The torus field can be imported using a symmetric map or a full 3D map. The symmetric map is defined in half of a CLAS12
sector. It is symmetric around the sector midplane and copied in each sector when requested by the Geant4 navigation.
The 3D map covers the entire Cartesian space and accounts for field deviations due to coil movements or imperfections
\cite{GhoshalSolenoid}.

The field map has 251 points along the $z$-axis from 1~m to 3~m. It has 2501 points in the transverse coordinate from
0~to 5~m. It has 16 azimuthal points from 0\mdeg \ to 30\mdeg. The field grid values are linearly interpolated to the
$(x,y,z)$ coordinate requested by Geant4.

The torus field in the sector midplane is perpendicular to the $z$-axis and is typically 2.058~T. Table~\ref{tab:torMap}
shows the field map ASCII data structure.
