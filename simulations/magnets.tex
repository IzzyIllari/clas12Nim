\section{Solenoid and Torus Magnets}


\subsection{Geometry}
The solenoid geometry is produced with the GEMC perl api. The solenoid is a single polycone volume, shown in \F{solenoid}
in a section view with the central detector components and the target.

The torus geometry is imported from the engineering CAD model through 54 tessellated volumes. Among the volumes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the bore heat shield and hub components
	\item the back and front plants
	\item the stainless steel coil frames
	\item the copper coils
	\item internal shielding around the hub
\end{itemize}

The geometry is shown in \F{torus}.
