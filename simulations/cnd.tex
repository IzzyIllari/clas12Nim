\subsection{Central Neutron Detector (CND)}

The CND geometry is implemented through the native GEMC geometry API.
The paddles are Geant4 generic trapezoids (see \F{cndGeometry}). The u-turn light guides are Geant4 ``polycones''
(volumes with cylindrical symmetry with varying radius along one axis).
The paddles are assigned the scintillator material and associated with the CND hit process routine.

\subsubsection{Digitization}

The energy deposited is reduced based on the position in the paddle using the calibrated light attenuation length.
Two signals are then propagated, one to the PMT attached to the scintillator (``direct hit''), and one traveling
through the scintillator junction onto the other scintillator and its PMT (``indirect hit'').
Layer-dependent factors, applied to the two  signals, account for the light loss in the u-turn and in the neighboring paddle.
These factors were determined during cosmic-ray tests.

The corrected energy is converted to the theoretical number of photons $N_{th}$ using the constant 1210 $\gamma$/MeV,
which accounts for light propagation in the 1.4 m long light guides, for losses at the junctions and for the
quantum efficiency of the photo-multiplier.
A Poissonian distribution is used to calculate the actual number of photons $N_{actual}$ and the resulting ``smeared'' energy
is then converted to ADC using the FADC conversion factor.

The absolute hit time is corrected using calibration constants estimated from data:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the effective velocity;
	\item a left/right time offset factor;
	\item the Birks-attenuation factor;
	\item the position and corresponding paddle length of the direct and the indirect hit.
\end{itemize}

The time is then smeared by a resolution read from CCDB using a Gaussian function and then digitized using a TDC conversion factor.
The Birks factor, reducing the deposited
energy depending on the particle type, enters in the timing calculation as
follows: the direct and indirect times are smeared with a Gaussian
function having a width directly proportional to an empirically determined
constant, and inversely proportional to the square root of the measured
light (which is, in turn, proportional to the attenuated energy).
The digitized output bank variables are summarized in Table \ref{tab:cndBank}.

The time window  of the CND is set to 400 ns: all Geant4 steps within the same paddle and time window are collected in one hit.
