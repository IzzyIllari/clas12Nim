\subsection{Geometry}

The FTOF geometry is implemented through the COATJAVA geometry service.
The service provides the geant4 definitions that are read by the GEMC perl api to build the geometry database.

Each layer is a generic G4Trapezoid, tilted by $+6^O$ or $-6^O$ depending if they are part of a stereo superlayer or not.
The 12 layers in each region (6 per superlayer) are placed in a region mother volume made of air, see \F{dcGeometry}.
