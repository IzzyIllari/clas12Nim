\subsection{Drift Chambers (DC)}

The DC geometry is implemented through the JAVA geometry service.
The service provides the Geant4 definitions that are read by the GEMC PERL API to build the geometry database.

For each of the six sectors of the CLAS12 Forward Detector, there are three drift chambers: one in front of the torus magnet,
one between the torus coils, and one after the torus.  These three chambers are referred to as different ``regions''.
The chambers are strung with the wires arranged in 12 internal layers.
Each layer is a generic G4Trapezoid, tilted by +6\mdeg \ or -6\mdeg \ depending if they are in the first or second
``superlayer'' of a region.
The 12 layers in each region (6 per superlayer) are placed in a region mother volume made of air (see \F{dcGeometry}).
The layers are assigned the DC gas mixture: 90$\%$ argon/10$\%$ CO$_2$. Each layer is associated with the DC hit process routine.
The hit wire identification is performed in the Process ID routine.

             Geant4 trapezoids are the mother volumes corresponding to DC Regions 1, 2, and 3.
             The track is a negative pion, hitting the various layers inside each region.
             The hits are indicated by the white markers. Due to the high DC
             efficiency, most tracks produce at least one hit in each layer (12 hits/region).
             The wire hit inefficiencies are incorporated in the simulation parameters to match the experimental data.}

\subsubsection{Process ID}
The wire number is calculated using the formula $n_i = y/\delta y$, where $y$ is the
distance from the center of the DC layer trapezoid volume projected along its vertical axis and $\delta Y$
is the distance between each wire.
The wire sagging due to gravity and mechanical deflections of the wire end-plates due to the tension
load are not taken into account.

\subsubsection{Digitization}

First, the distance of closest approach of the passing track to the hit wire ($DOCA$) is computed for the hit in each layer.
At each Geant4 step, the distance of the track from the wire is calculated.
The $DOCA$ is extracted among the points with energy deposited larger than 50~eV,
for which the sum of the step time + $DOCA$/DV (where DV is the drift velocity) is minimal.

An initial time $T_i$ is calculated with a time to distance function that is the inverse of
what is determined from calibration and used in reconstruction to go from TDC to $DOCA$.
The function takes into account:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the distance from the wire, in cm;
	\item the cell size in each superlayer;
	\item the polar angle of the track;
	\item magnitude of the torus field
\end{itemize}

A time walk correction function $T_w$ is applied to $T_i$ that includes discrete ionization effects based on the following input:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the distance from the wire, in cm;
	\item the cell size in each superlayer;
	\item the velocity of the particle;
	\item an overall parameter to adjust to data at small distances from the wire.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The resulting $T_w$ is then used in a Landau-function to mimic the detector response function.

An intrinsic random time walk correction $\sigma_{TW}$ due to multiple scattering is calculated and the time is smeared with
a Gaussian function using $\sigma_{TW}$ as the resolution.
A random number is thrown (between 0 and 1) and if it is above the efficiency function, calculated based on $DOCA$,
the hit is rejected.
Finally, the timing is smeared using the calibrated residual versus $DOCA$ function (see \F{dcResolution}).

The simulation time window of the DC is set to 500~ns: all Geant4 steps within the same cell and time window are
collected in one hit.
The actual readout electronics time window is set to 250, 500, and 750~ns for Regions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.


\subsubsection{Background Rates}

A detailed study of the background rates coming from beam interacting with the target was done to ensure that
the DC occupancy stays within limits that do not affect the track reconstruction efficiency, typically below $5\%$.

Given the operating luminosity L=\cLuminosity and the liquid-hydrogen target length of 5 cm, the beam electron rate
is R=4.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ Hz. This corresponds to around 124,000 electrons in the DC 250 ns time window of Region 1.

Various analyses \cite{targetStudy, clas12Beamline, clas12Background}, were performed using 124,000 electrons/event
to study the DC occupancy response to variations of hardware position and beamline configurations.
The rates were scaled in Region 2 and 3 to take into account the difference between the real and simulated time window.
The results are summarized in \F{dcOccupancy}. The highest DC occupancy is in Region 1.
The source is mostly electromagnetic background from the target and beamline elements.
Regions 2 and 3 are shielded against leptons by the torus magnetic field.
Region 3 is exposed to radiation coming from the interactions of the broadened beam
(due to interactions in the target) with the torus components (especially the most downstream elements).
In general, the occupancy in the DC affects the track reconstruction efficiency. A value of 3$\%$ occupancy in Region 1
is considered an optimal compromise between luminosity and reconstruction efficiency \cite{recon-nim}.
