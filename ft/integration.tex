\section{Integration in CLAS12}
The FT mechanical design  has been driven by geometrical constraints imposed by the rest of CLAS12, geometrical acceptance optimization and performance optimization, taking into account cooling, material budget, and front-end electronics location.
The FT detects electrons scattered between $2.5^\circ$ an $4.5^\circ$ w.r.t. the beam axis. To allow this acceptance, the FT calorimeter must cover down to $2^\circ$ and up to $5^\circ$ with lead tungstate crystals. Since no massive materials are allowed at angles larger than $5.5^\circ$, crystals, cooling, mechanical supports and tungsten shielding have been optimized in a very compact design. Outside this $5.5^\circ$ we will only have insulating material, which has a very low density, $35\,$kg/m$^3$, and routing for cabling and services in the blind area of the CLAS12 detector, where the toroidal magnet coils are.

The FT is built by several parts that can be grouped as follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item{the inner tungsten pipe,}
\item{the tungsten cone acting as Moeller electrons shield,}
\item{the tracker,}
\item{the hodoscope,}
\item{the calorimeter,}
\item{the front-end electronics,}
\item{cabling and services.}
\end{itemize}

From the mechanical point of view, the most challenging parts are the integration of the calorimeter, due to the weight and fragility of the crystals and the relative positioning and alignment of the FT components.




\subsection{Constraints from other sub-detectors}

The FT must has been  installed around the beam line between the High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC) and the first layer of Drift Chambers. The HTCC is movable along the beam axis. In operating position, it extends up to $1730\,$mm downstream w.r.t. the Interaction Point (IP). This plane defines the upstream border of the allowance for the FT. The first layer of Drift Chambers is installed in front of the toroidal magnet coils, with an inclination of $68^\circ$ w.r.t. the beam axis. The front-end electronics boards of the Drift Chambers define the downstream border of the allowance for the FT. The minimum distance of the Drift Chambers boards from the beam axis is $\sim140\,$mm at $2280\,$mm downstream w.r.t. the IP. Taking into account the outside radius of the FT, including insulation, and the inclination of the Drift Chambers, the FT can not exceed $\sim2150\,$mm w.r.t. the IP.

The FT needs cabling and services routing, for gases and cooling. These services must be connected to the outside of CLAS12. All services are installed in the shadow area of the toroidal magnet coils, i.e. in six slots extending radially from the beam line to the periphery. Each coil is  $\sim100\,$mm thick, allowing us to host also some front-end electronics, which must be close to the detectors.

The whole FT is  attached to the toroidal magnet cryostat by a support pipe with a proper flange. This is needed both for mounting sequence constraints and to avoid massive supports in front of the Drift Chambers.  A proper system  allows for precise alignment and positioning of the detector w.r.t. the beam line and the IP.

 The FT-Cal is kept in position w.r.t. the inner tungsten pipe via four radial supports, made of PEEK. PEEK has been chosen because of its low thermal conductivity ($0.25\,$W/m$\cdot$K) and its relatively high tensile strength ($\sim100\,$MPa). In addition, it features high radiation hardness and excellent stability over a broad range of temperatures.

The tungsten cone is attached to the inner tungsten pipe with a system of flanges and o-rings, to allow evacuation of the beam line if needed. The tungsten cone will end, in the downstream direction, with a cylindrical section where  tracker and hodoscope are bolted. They are located between $1740\,$mm and $1795\,$mm downstream w.r.t. the IP. The FT clearance  is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:integra}.

\subsection{Cabling and services routing}
All services and cables necessary for the operation of the FT detectors are routed along the torus coils to minimize the interference with the CLAS12 Forward Detector. These include the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item{FT-Cal:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{signal cables (332 coaxial cables with diameter of 2.5 mm),}
\item{HV (3 multiwire cables with diameter of 15 mm) and LV cables (6 cables with diameter of 3 mm),}
\item{slow controls (32 wires with diameter or 2 mm),}
\item{cooling pipes (2 thermally-insulated pipes with diamater of 35 mm) and gas lines (2 pipes with diameter of 8 mm);}
\end{enumerate}
\item{FT-Hodo:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{optical fibers (768 1-mm fibers grouped in 48 bundles for a total diameter of 55 mm);}
\end{enumerate}
\item{FT-Trck:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{optical fibers for the transmission of the digitized (8 lines with diameter of 2 mm),}
\item{slow controls (3 usb cables),}
\item{HV (8 cables) and LV (4 wires for a total diameter of 4 mm) cables,}
\item{gas lines (2 pipes with diameter of 8 and 12 mm) and cooling lines (3 inlet tubes with diamater of 3 mm and 3 outlet tubes with section of 500 mm$^2$).}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


Cables and pipes are grouped and routed along the direction of the magnet coils using appropriate rails. The rails width and depth has been chosen
to be compatible with  space occupied by  CLAS12 Drift Chambers (both during normal operation  and maintenance) and clearance between the HTCC and the CLAS12 Forward Detector.
