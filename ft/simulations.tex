\section{Detector simulations}

Detailed simulations of the FT have been done with the
GEANT4-based Monte Carlo code for CLAS12, GEMC~\cite{gemc} 
to optimize the detectors design, develop reconstruction algorithms and understand the detectors performance.

Details on the implementation in GEMC of the detector geometry and digitization are reported in Ref.~{gemc}, while an extensive discussion of the simulation studies that guided the detector design are presented in Ref.~\cite{ft-tdr}. Here we focus on summarizing the results of simulations studies that are relevant to understand the FT performance.

\subsubsection{Leakage corrections}
The reconstructed cluster energy can result to be systematically
smaller than the actual energy of the particle that induced the shower. This is due to leakages in the shower containment caused by the limited dimension of the calorimeter, by cuts in the clustering algorithms and thresholds in the hit detection. An example of the difference between the reconstructed cluster energy and the simulated electron energy is shown in the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:gemc_leakage}. This was obtained assuming an equivalent threshold on  the individual crystals of 10 MeV:
the leakage varies from $\sim 80$ MeV (16\%) for 500 MeV electrons to $\sim 300$ MeV (6.6\%) for 4.5 GeV electrons.

This effect can be easily corrected for by
parametrizing the leakage as function of the reconstructed cluster energy and position and applying the
correction in reconstruction. In the specific case, simulations of single electrons were performed in GEMC and the difference between the reconstructed cluster energy and the electron energy was studied as a function of the cluster seed crystal. For each crystal, the dependence of this difference on the reconstructed cluster energy was fitted to a 4th-order polynomial function which was then used as an additive correction to the reconstructed cluster energy. The final dependence
of the difference between corrected cluster energy and simulated
energy is shown in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:gemc_leakage}.

crystal signal. Bottom: difference between the

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic background and radiation dose}
The electromagnetic background produced by the interaction of the electron beam in the target  at the nominal CLAS12 luminosity was simulated in GEMC. For this purpose, in each event, about 124000, 11 GeV, electrons were generated originating 10 cm upstream the target. The electrons were distributed randomly with the radio-frequency structure of the CEBAF beam in a 250 ns window. This number of electrons corresponds to the number of beam electrons that would pass through the target in the chosen time window at the nominal CLAS12 luminosity of 10$^{35}$ cm $^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.
These simulations were used to study background rates in each of the FT detector, determine the pile-up probability and estimate the radiation dose the FT would be subject to during operations.

The overall particle rate was found to be of about 120 MHz, being dominated by very low energy particles and with only 6\% due to particles with energy above 100 MeV. In the energy range to be tagged (0.5-4.5 GeV) the overall particle rate is further reduced to about 180 KHz, equally shared between photons and hadrons. 

For the FT-Cal, the energy deposition in each crystal was evaluated from the background simulation and used to calculate the dose per unit of time. The overall radiation dose at $10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s${-1}$ was estimated to be less than 1.5 rad/h when averaged over the entire calorimeter with a distribution on the calorimeter crystals as\\ shown by Fig.~\ref{fig:ft_rad}. The maximum dose per crystal is of about 3 rad/h, which would result in an maximum integrated dose per crystal of about 2160 rad in 30 days of beam time.
