\section{Reconstruction}
Reconstruction of the FT detectors information and matching between detectors to determine the type and 3-momentum of the incident particles is implemented in the CLAS12 Java reconstruction framework. Details on the algorithms and implementation are provided in Ref.~cite{reconstruction}. In the following we briefly summarize the main steps and final outputs.

FT-Cal hits are reconstructed from the analysis of the recorded fADC information to extract energy and time; hits are then associated based on position and time to form clusters whose energy and centroid position are used as initial seed to define the 3-momentum of the incident particles. Similarly, FT-Hodo hits are reconstructed from the fADC raw information and matched based on position and timing to form clusters of matching tiles in the two layers of the detector. These are matched to clusters in the calorimeter based on position and time to distinguish charged particles from neutrals. Finally, FT-Trk hits are also reconstructed from the raw data and geometrically grouped to form clusters in each of the detector layers separately. Combinations of clusters in the x-y layers of each of the two subdetectors are used to define crosses that are finally matched to calorimeter clusters to improve the determination of the impact point of the particle.
