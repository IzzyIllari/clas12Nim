\section{Introduction}
An experimental program focused on thesearch for exotics and the study of rare mesons requires measurements of a broad scope of final states in order to consolidate the possible evidence of a resonance by looking at different decay modes and exploring poorly studied reaction channels \cite{mesonex}.
The characteristics of the detector and the trigger conditions foreseen for the experiment - 11 GeV electron beam scattering on a 5-cm-long LH$_2$ target with multiple prongs in the final state - will allow  measurements of many final states simultaneously. While the hadrons will be detected in the CLAS12 spectrometer~\cite{overview}, the electron scattered at very small angles (2.5$^\circ$ to 4.5$^\circ$ in polar angle) and low four-momentum transfer, $Q^2$,  will be detected in the Forward Tagger (FT), i.e. in the kinematics of quasi-real photoproduction.
The FT  specifications  were thus defined to have optimal electron detection at low angles, compatible with the high rate of electromagnetic background.
To reconstruct the  quasi-real photon variables, it is necessary to measure the scattered electron three momentum.
The relevant quantities are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the energy $E_{e'}$: since the photon energy is given by $E_\gamma =\nu=E_{Beam}-E_{e'}$ and its linear polarization
 by $P_\gamma=\epsilon^{-1}=1+\frac{\nu^2}{2 E_{Beam} E_{e'}}$,
\item the azimuthal angle $\phi_{e'}$ to determine the polarization plane, 
\item the polar angle angle $\theta_{e'}$: since $Q^2 = 4 E_{Beam} E_{e'} \sin^2{\theta_{e'}/2}$.
\end{itemize}

The Forward Tagger is composed of: 
an electromagnetic calorimeter  (FT-Cal), to identify the
electron by measuring its electromagnetic shower energy and to provide a fast trigger signal, a tracker (FT-Trk),  to measure the scattering angles ($\theta_{e'}$ and $\phi_{e'}$) with the required accuracy, and a  scintillation counter (FT-Hodo) to provide $e/\gamma$ separation. A dedicated trigger system has been developed to provide a fast signal to trigger the data acquisition~\cite{daq} in coincidence with signals from CLAS12.

The FT is located in the free space between the High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC)~\cite{htcc} and the first Drift Chamber (DC) region~\cite{dc}. The FT calorimeter shown in blue is located at about 185 cm from the interaction point, shown by the green cross, and is enclosed in a Rohacell case to provide thermal insulation. The scintillation counter (green) and first tracker layer (red) are located in front of the calorimeter.

The calorimeter, the scintillation counter, and the tracker
are placed between the High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC)~\cite{htcc} and the torus magnet support~\cite{magnets}, at about 185 cm downstream of the nominal target position. The close proximity
to the beamline ($2.5^\circ$ corresponds to $\sim 8$ cm) and the limited space available (at most $\sim 40$ cm along the beam axis), requires a compact calorimeter with small radiation length and with very good radiation hardness. Figure~\ref{fig:calinclas12} shows 
a CAD drawing of the FT integrated in CLAS12. 
The FT-Hodo scintillation counter, placed in front of the calorimeter, is made of plastic scintillator tiles 
read-out by silicon photomultipliers via wavelength shifting fibers. The FT-Trk detector is then located in front of the scintillation counter to extend the CLAS12 forward tracker down to 2.5$^\circ$.
All of these components were designed to fit within a 5.5$^{\circ}$ cone around the beam axis to have no impact on the operation and acceptance of the CLAS12 equipment in the forward detector.
