The Micromegas Vertex Tracker was designed to improve the tracking capabilities of the baseline design of the
CLAS12 spectrometer in Hall~B at Jefferson Laboratory. A Barrel Micromegas Tracker made with six concentric
cylinders, each made of three 120$^\circ$-sector tiles, surrounds the Silicon Vertex Tracker and a Forward
Micromegas Tracker composed of 6 disks is placed 30~cm downstream of the liquid-hydrogen target. Both trackers
sit in a 5~T solenoid magnetic field. All Micromegas elements are based on the resistive technology to withstand
luminosities up to $10^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, as well as on the bulk technology to enforce gain uniformity and
mechanical robustness. Due to the high magnetic field, dedicated electronics have been designed and displaced
$\sim$2~m away from the detectors. The electronic readout is based on the DREAM ASICs that allow sustained
operation up to 20~kHz trigger rate at the maximum luminosity.
