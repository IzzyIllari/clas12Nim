The Micromegas Vertex Tracker aims at improving the tracking capabilites of CLAS12 baseline design. A Barrel Micromegas Tracker made of six concentric cylinders, each made of three 120$^o$-sector tiles, surrounds the Silicon Vertex Tracker and a Forward Micromegas Tracker composed of 6 disks is placed 30~cm downstream of the liquid hydrogen target. Both trackers sit in a 5T-solenoid magnetic field. All Micromegas elements are based on the resistive technology to withstand luminosities up to $10^{35}~\text{Hz cm}^{-2}$ as well as on the bulk technology to enforce gain uniformity and mechanical robustness.
Due to the high magnetic field, a dedicated electronics has been designed and displaced up to 2-meters away from the detectors. The electronic readout is based on the DREAM ASICs allowing to sustain up to 20~kHz trigger rate at maximal luminosity.
