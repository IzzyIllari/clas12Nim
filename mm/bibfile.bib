abstract = "We measured the Lorentz angle in an argon +10% isobutane mixture using a Micromegas detector placed inside the CLAS-DVCS solenoid of Hall B at the Jefferson Laboratory. The primary goal of these tests was to validate Magboltz-based simulations developed for the implementation of Micromegas bulk detectors in the Central Tracker of the future CLAS12 spectrometer. We used a UV laser to extract electrons from the drift electrode of the detector. After amplification, the electrons were collected on the readout strips and the signals recorded. The difference of position observed between runs with and without magnetic field provided a direct measurement of the Lorentz angle. Scans in the drift electric field were performed for the first time in very high magnetic fields, up to 4.2T, and a good agreement was observed with the Magboltz predictions."

abstract = "We describe a novel structure for a gaseous detector that is under development at Saclay. It consists of a two-stage parallet-plate avalanche chamber of small amplification gap (100 μm) combined with a conversion-drift space. It follows a fast removal of positive ions produced during the avalanche development. Fast signals (≤1 ns) are obtained during the collection of the electron avalanche on the anode microstrip plane. The positive ion signal has a duration of 100 ns. The fast evacuation of positive ions combined with the high granularity of the detector provide a high rate capability. Gas gains of up to 105 have been achieved."

abstract = "In this paper, we present a novel way to manufacture the bulk Micromegas detector. A simple process based on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology is employed to produce the entire sensitive detector. Such a fabrication process could be extended to very large area detectors made by the industry. The low cost fabrication together with the robustness of the electrode materials will make it attractive for several applications ranging from particle physics and astrophysics to medicine."
