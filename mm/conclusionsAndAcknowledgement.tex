\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, the CLAS12 Micromegas Vertex Tracker system is presented. The mechanical structure of the Forward and the Barrel Micromegas Trackesr, the first curved detector of this size using the Micromegas technology, is described. The architecture and performances of the readout electronics are presented, including the Dream ASIC, developed to achieve the performances required by the CLAS12 specifications. The Micromegas Vertex Tracker performances with cosmic rays are shown as well as some preliminary results on beam data demonstrating a significant improvement of the reconstruction in the central tracker.
