\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, the CLAS12 Micromegas Vertex Tracker system is presented. The mechanical structure of the
Forward and the Barrel Micromegas Trackers, the first curved detector of this size using the Micromegas technology,
is described. The architecture and performance of the readout electronics are presented, including the DREAM ASIC,
developed to achieve the performance required by the CLAS12 specifications. The Micromegas Vertex Tracker
performance with cosmic rays is shown, as well as some preliminary results with beam data to demonstrate a significant
improvement in the reconstruction in the central tracker.
