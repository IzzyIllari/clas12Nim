\section{Conclusions}

To address the change of its scope from electron to pion identification for momenta greater than 3.5~GeV,
the original CLAS Cherenkov Counters were refurbished at part of the new CLAS12 Low Threshold Cherenkov
Counter (LTCC) system. The work included improvements of the reflectivities for the mirrors and the Winston
cones, p-terphenyl coating of the PMTs, expansion of the gas volumes, and redesign of the box walls and patch
panels. The LTCC detector sectors after refurbishment are shown in \F{ltccInstalled} installed on the CLAS12
Forward Carriage upstream of the Forward Time-of-Flight system. The average LTCC efficiency for electron
detection in the momentum range from 3.5 to 6.5~GeV is 94\%. The pion efficiency starts around 50\% near
the expected signal threshold, and rises with momentum as expected. A plateau of 88\% is reached at a momentum
of 5~GeV. This is within range of an expectation of efficiency above 90\%. Additional future studies are required
to full quantify the detection efficiency of the CLAS12 LTCC for both positive and negative pions as a function of
momentum.
