\section{Conclusion}

To address the change of its scope from electron to pion identification for momenta
greater than 3.5 GeV, the LTCC has been refurbished. The work included improvements of reflectivities for mirrors and Winston Cones, p-terphenyl
coating the of PMTs, expansion of the gas volumes, redesign of box walls and new patch panel.
The LTCC detector sectors after refurbishment are show in \F{ltccInstalled}.
