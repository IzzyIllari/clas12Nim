\section{Conclusion}

To address the change of its scope from electron to pion identification for momenta
greater than 3.5 GeV, the LTCC has been refurbished. The work included improvements of the
reflectivities for the mirrors and the Winston cones, p-terphenyl
coating of the PMTs, expansion of the gas volumes, and redesign of the box walls and patch panels.
The LTCC detector sectors after refurbishment are show in \F{ltccInstalled}.
Performance conclusion here too.
