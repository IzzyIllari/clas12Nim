\section{Electronics and readout}

\F{electronicScheme} shows a schematic diagram of the electronics and readout used for the LTCC detector.

The XP4500B Photonis PMTs are powered with positive polarity by a CAEN SY4527 high voltage mainframe outfitted with 1501P boards.

There are two anode signals from the PMT output. One of them is connected directly to flash ADC
boards built at Jefferson Lab, the Flash ADC module FADC250. The FADC250 sampling frequency is 250 $MHz$.
The other signal is discriminated by a Jefferson Lab made discriminator unit (named DSC2) and connected to CAEN v1190 TDC modules.
The TDCs were set to have 50 ps/channel timing resolution.

The LTCC FADC250 and TDC information are read out using the CLAS12 Data Acquisition system \cite{daq2019}.

				The patch panels then connects the HV to CAEN SY4527 (1501P boards), one readout to the FADC250 and the other to DSC2 discriminators.}

A typical signal from the FADC250 module is shown in \F{fadc}. The signal is usually contained in 3 to 5 time samples (each time sample is 4 ns).
In order to be written to tape, at least one of the 100 signals must be above a 30 channels threshold. The FADC250 then consider a time window 16 ns (4 samples)
before the threshold crossing time, for the duration of 20 samples (80 ns). The final integrated charge used in the reconstruction code is the signal integral
minus the electronic pedestal, as described in \F{fadc}.

            The CODA system saves a 400 ns time window (100 samples) if at least one of the 100 signals is above a 30 channels threshold.
				The integral signal is the sum of the output at the sample indexes between the two red arrows:
            the left red arrow is placed 4 samples before the signal crosses the threshold,
            and the right red arrow is 20 samples after that. The final integrated charge used in the reconstruction code is this integral minus the pedestal.
            The pedestal is calculated using the average of the signal between the green arrows.
				The absolute position of the peak and green arrows, and the relative position of the red arrows are adjusted in CODA parameters loaded before each run.}
