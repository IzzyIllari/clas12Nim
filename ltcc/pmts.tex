\subsection{Photo-multipliers surface coating}

The PMTs used in the LTCC are the photonis are the Photonis XP4500B \cite{Photonis:2007ta}.
Their borosilicate windows can be used to detect wavelengths as low as approximately
$300$ nm. This is the most limiting factor of enhanced QE in the UV region, where most of the Cherenkov
light is emitted (see eq.~\ref{eq:cerenkov}), given that the $C_4F_{10}$ gas is transparent down to
wavelengths of $180$ nm, and the mirrors and WCs reflectivities is non zero
even for wavelengths below $200$ nm.

While quartz windows maximize the UV-sensitivity of the PMT, they are difficult and expensive to produce.

A wavelength shifter (WLS) deposited on the face of a borosilicate or UV glass
PMT provides an effective alternative to boost the efficiency of a \u{C}erenkov
detector by converting UV photons with a wavelength below $300$ nm into two
isotropically emitted photons with longer wavelengths.

The QE gained by a deposition of p-terphenyl (PT) on a borosilicate windows
photonis PMT \cite{Koczon:1457653} is shown in \F{pmtQuantumEfficiencyGain}.
The yield increase between 200 and 300 nm, where most of the Cherenkov light
detectable by the LTCC optics is concentrated, is dramatic.

Several tests were performed in collaboration with the Temple University physics department using the equipment schematics
shown in \F{pmtTestingSetup}. The setup used a monochromator with a precision of 182 0.35 nm and two PMTs (one for the measurement,
one for reference calibration). The PMTs were switched to confirm the stability of the results. Each PMT was measured
while coated and then again after the coating had been removed using acetone and isopropanol.
The observed photon rate was read out by a scaler 194 with a âˆ’24mV threshold.

The results from 2 different PMTs each at 2 different positions were found to be
consistent. \F{ptQEResults} shows the average measured gain from these four
measurements. The observed gain was found to be consistent with the nominal
prediction for a perfectly saturated coating.

            $110\,\mu g/cm^2$ (dashed line).}

\end{figure}

Based on these results, 200 PMTs were treated with an optimal material load of $110 \mu g/ cm^2$,
corresponding to a PT thickness of $894 nm$ \cite{Joosten:2016lcl}. This correspond to an overall
increase of PMT response to Cherenkov light of about 40\%.

In \F{ptExample} (top) an example of deposition of a test glass is shown. Notice that the ciating is almost
transparent in the visible light spectrum. At the bottom of the figure the actual setup used at Temple
University is shown.
