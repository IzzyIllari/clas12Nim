\subsection{PMT Surface Coating}

The PMTs used in the LTCC are Photonis XP4500Bs~\cite{Photonis:2007ta}. Their borosilicate windows can be used
to detect photons of wavelengths as low as approximately 300~nm. This is the most limiting factor of enhanced
quantum efficiency (QE) in the UV region, where most of the Cherenkov light is emitted (see Eq.~\ref{eq:cerenkov}),
given that the C$_4$F$_{10}$ gas is transparent down to wavelengths of 180~nm, and the mirror and WC reflectivities
are non-zero even for wavelengths below 200~nm. While quartz windows maximize the UV-sensitivity of the PMT, they
are fragile and expensive. A wavelength shifter (WLS) deposited on the face of a borosilicate or UV-transmitting
glass PMT provides an effective alternative to boost the efficiency of a Cherenkov detector by converting UV photons
with a wavelength below 300~nm into two isotropically emitted photons with longer wavelengths.

The projected QE gained by a deposition of p-terphenyl (PT) on the XP4500Bs PMT is shown in
\F{pmtQuantumEfficiencyGainAndExample}~\cite{Koczon:1457653}. The gain at shorter wavelengths near 200~nm,
where most of the Cherenkov light detectable by the LTCC optics is concentrated, is more than a factor of 3.

Several tests were performed in collaboration with the Temple University Physics Department using the equipment
schematics shown in \F{pmtTestingSetupAndptQEResults} (top). The setup used a monochromator with a precision
of 0.35~nm and two PMTs (one for the measurement, one for the reference calibration). The PMTs were switched
to confirm the stability of the results. Each PMT was measured while coated and then again after the coating had
been removed using acetone and isopropanol. The observed photon rate was read out by a scaler.

The results from 2 different PMTs each at 2 different positions were found to be consistent.
\F{pmtTestingSetupAndptQEResults} (bottom) shows the average measured gain from these four measurements. The
observed gain was found to be consistent with the nominal prediction for a perfectly saturated coating.

Based on these results, 200 PMTs were treated \cite{Joosten:2016lcl} with an optimal material load of
110~$\mu$g/cm$^2$, corresponding to a PT thickness of 894~nm. This corresponded to an overall increase of the PMT
response to Cherenkov light of about 40\%. The 110~$\mu$g/cm$^2$ of PT provides an almost transparent coating to
the visible light spectrum.
