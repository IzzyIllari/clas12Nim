\subsection{Mirror Re-coating}

As seen in \F{optics}, each LTCC segment is composed of four optical surfaces: three mirrors and one Winston cone.
The mirrors have elliptical, cylindrical, and hyperbolic profiles in the longitudinal direction and are flat in the transverse
direction. The reflectivity of a random selection of 30 elliptical, cylindrical, and hyperbolic mirrors from two sectors
was measured. All of the tested mirrors showed significant degradation from the original desired reflectivity of
90\% in the visible spectrum, see for example \F{reflectivityBeforeAndAfter} (top). A refurbishment of the mirrors
was crucial to enhance the detector response to pions because the intensity of their emitted  Cherenkov light is greatly
reduced compared to electrons, see \F{refurbishmentGains} ``no changes'' case. Due to the material, assembly,
and dimensions of the different types of mirrors, two different techniques were employed to refurbish the reflective
surfaces as discussed below.

\subsubsection{Re-coating of Cylindrical Mirrors}

The cylindrical mirrors range from 6 to 12~in long. Each mirror is made from a single piece of aluminum or plastic. Due
to their small size, they fit in most vacuum chambers used to coat mirrors by evaporation of aluminum with magnesium
fluoride (\coating). After successful testing of \coating\ re-coating onto the existing substrate, the work of
re-coating the 216 cylindrical mirrors was awarded to ECI~\cite{ECI}. See \F{reflectivityBeforeAndAfter} (bottom)
for typical reflectivity values after re-coating.

\subsubsection{Re-coating of Elliptical and Hyperbolic Mirrors}

The elliptical and hyperbolic mirrors are composed of a Kevlar support structure with a Lexan substrate. It was not
possible to change this hardware from its original design and construction (in 1997). The support material, which
allowed for pitch, roll, and yaw alignment of the mirrors, included wood and aluminum pieces that were glued to the
support structure.

	\caption{Top: Reflectivity measurements as a function of wavelength for a sample of 8 mirrors before re-coating,
          each tested at two different places on their surface. The reflectivity was measured using a monochromator
          (Newport model CS260-USB-1-FH-A) with a deuterium light source with a reach between 200~nm and 400~nm.
          The average reflectivity was about 65\% instead of the optimal 90\%. Bottom: Reflectivity measurements as a
          function of wavelength for a sample of 5 mirrors measured after gluing on the Lexan strips (see text for
          details). Note the very high value of reflectivity in the UV region, where most of the Cherenkov light is
          produced. In the visible spectrum, the reflectivity is about 90\%.}

\end{figure}

Several companies attempted to re-coat these mirrors but failed because the out-gassing of the mirrors' substrate
materials prevented the chambers used to evaporate the coating onto the surfaces to reach the necessary vacuum
levels. Furthermore, many of the mirrors are longer than 1~m, exceeding the size of most vacuum chambers.
Therefore the \coating\ could not be re-deposited directly onto the mirror substrates.

A different approach consisted of coating thin (25~$\mu$m) Lexan strips and gluing the strips onto the mirror
substrates. While promising, this presented the challenge of protecting the coated Lexan strip from possible
damage during shipping and handling, and during the gluing process to the mirrors.

A working chain was setup to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item coat the Lexan strip;
	\item protect the strip with a temporary peel-able film for safe shipping and handling to JLab;
	\item glue the strip to the mirror substrates;
	\item remove the protective film;
	\item test the reflectivity.
\end{enumerate}

Several companies produced various test samples with various protective material films. The job was eventually
awarded to ECI~\cite{ECI}. The gluing of the strips to the mirror was done at JLab. The mirrors were
vacuum-mounted on a supporting structure. Loctite spray contact adhesive glue was applied on the mirror and
directed out by a venting system. The strip was applied to the substrate and after 24 hours of curing time the film
was removed. The mirrors were monitored for shape changes due to glue joint shrinkage; none were observed during
an initial test period of several days and later throughout the application of the strips to all substrates.
The typical reflectivity of the refurbished mirrors is shown in \F{reflectivityBeforeAndAfter} (bottom).

\subsubsection{Elliptical Mirror Gaps}

The LTCC elliptical mirrors, especially the longest ones, presented several gaps between the mirrors, some a few
cm long. This was evident also in the data analyses as a loss of efficiency between the mirrors. To make sure that
no light is lost in these gaps, additional 120-$\mu$m thick Lexan extension strips were produced and coated with
\coating. These strips were manufactured by ECI~\cite{ECI}. They were fitted and glued on the left side
elliptical mirrors to cover the gaps (see \F{gapBeforeAndAfter}).

\subsection{Mirror Alignment}
\label{sec:mirrorAlignment}

A new procedure was developed to align the mirrors within the LTCC boxes that takes advantage of their focusing
capabilities. The elliptical mirror focal points (see \F{alignmentSimulation}) are 1. the target (origin of the lab
coordinate system) and 2. a point behind the hyperbolic mirror. The focal points of the hyperbolic mirrors are 1. a
point near the focal point of the elliptical mirrors and 2. a point above the face of the PMTs.

\begin{figure}[hb]

	\includegraphics[width=0.98\columnwidth, height=0.7\columnwidth]{img/gapBefore.png}
	\includegraphics[width=0.98\columnwidth, height=0.7\columnwidth]{img/gapAfter.png}
	\caption{Top: the gaps between mirrors before refurbishing the LTCC. These gaps were also seeing in the data
          as a drop of efficiency near the middle of the detector, as the Cherenkov light was not collected. Bottom: all of
          the gaps are covered by the extension strips.}
	\label{fig:gapBeforeAndAfter}
\end{figure}

The geometrical shape of the mirrors has been built into the CLAS12 Geant4 simulation (called GEMC)~\cite{sim-nim}.
When a laser line coming from the target is directed at the mirror, it is focused on the hyperbolic focal point, then
directed at the PMT (see \F{alignmentSimulation}). This geometrical focusing was used during the mirror alignment:
a 3~mW, 635~nm laser was placed, relative to the detector, in the center of the CLAS12 coordinate system at the
location of the target, and the first ellipse focal point. The laser was mounted on a structure that allowed the beam
direction and line angle to move with respect to the floor, while keeping the origin of the laser at the coordinate
system origin. This position was accurate at the 0.5~mm level. The laser was spread through two cylindrical lenses into
a laser line and shone longitudinally along the center-line of each elliptical mirror. Both the elliptical and hyperbolic
mirrors were then adjusted in pitch, roll, and yaw to minimize the light spot dimensions and to center it in the middle
of the face of the PMT. The PMT entry glasses were protected from the laser line with custom-fitted cardboard
pieces. After alignment, the spot size of the laser was 5~mm.

	\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth, height=0.75\columnwidth]{img/mirrorAlignmentSimulationZoomed.png}
	\caption{The simulation of a laser line (white tracks are photons) originating from the target (first ellipse focal
          point) and directed at the elliptical mirrors. The photons are reflected to the second ellipse focal point. The
          hyperbole first focal point is near the ellipse focal point so the hyperbolic mirror reflects the incoming photons
          to the hyperbole second focal point, located above the face of the PMTs. This picture illustrates the procedure
          used for the alignment: the mirror positions were adjusted until the laser line originating from the target was
          focused on the face of the PMT.}

\subsubsection{Mirror Overlap and Repositioning}
\label{sec:possibleInefficiency}

Two issues that could not be fixed in the refurbishment may affect the detector efficiency:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item the mirrors had to be mounted following the original overlaps, see for example \F{gapBeforeAndAfter} (top).
    These overlaps were originally implemented to optimize the response to inbending (toward the beamline) electrons
    and are not optimal for outbending particles.
  \item the relocation of the last four mirror sets (15, 16, 17, and 18) (mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:mirrorRepos})
    may degrade the optics as the affected mirrors do not follow the optimal desired optics configuration with the
    target as the original focal point.
\end{enumerate}
