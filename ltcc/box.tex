\subsection{Box Cut and Support Relocation}
\label{sec:mirrorRepos}

The modification of the LTCC vessel design was necessary because all of the drift chambers in the CLAS12
spectrometer are flat as opposed to the drift chambers in CLAS that were of cylindrical shape. Therefore the
inlet of the LTCC vessel had to be modified from the original cylindrical to a flat profile, (see \F{boxCut}). As
a consequence of such a modification, the possibility of a significant increase of the radiator gas thickness in the
most important polar angular range of particle acceptance at small angles was considered and successfully
implemented. The mounting structure of the three mirror sets involved in the cut was repositioned. For this work,
new threaded holes were drilled in the frame and the old holes were plugged and sealed.

          cylindrical profile. The side-walls had to be cut near the top part of the frame and the mirror sets involved had
          to be relocated. A stainless steel nose window support was added to the original detector to increase the gas
          volume. The radiator gas thickness was consequentially smaller near the top frame modifications, however the
          old restriction of the window having to follow the cylindrical profile of the wall was removed and the window can
          be inflated to follow the flat profile from the bottom of the box to the nose. This leads to the gas radiator
          thickness increase detailed in \F{noseVolume}.}

\subsection{Nose Addition and Window Inflation}

In the original design the upstream window followed the cylindrical curvature of the frame side-walls. In the new
system, the window is designed to inflate to enlarge the gas volume in order to increase the number of Cherenkov
photons. In addition, a ``nose'' support (see \F{boxCut}) has been engineered to increase the gas volume. The nose
dimensions have been optimized to provide the necessary support, while at the same time, maximizing the gas volume
increase. The gas volume increase of the final configuration is shown in \F{noseVolume}.

          configuration as a function of distance from the nose in cm. Dashed: the percentage increase due to the
          window inflation compared to the original flat design. Solid: the additional percentage increase due to the
          nose addition.}

\subsection{Back-wall and Connectors}

Both the high voltage and the signal connectors that link the PMTs inside the LTCC box and the outside electronics
were not hermetic during CLAS operations and epoxy was used to minimize the leaks from these connectors. As
part of the back-wall refurbishment, the patch panel was rebuilt and hermetic connectors were used.

The new lightweight back-wall design is shown in \F{backWall}. The wall is supported by stainless steel bars that
enclose a panel made of foam enclosed by thin aluminum sheets to minimize the radiation length. The new patch
panels provide 3 connectors for each PMT: one for high voltage and two for the identical signals from the PMTs, due
to the modifications detailed in Section~\ref{sec:dividers}. One signal is digitized through a flash ADC and the other
one through a discriminator and TDC.

          (1 HV, 2 signals) from each PMT.}

          are linked to the spine through 0.127-mm thick stainless steel cables and tensioned through springs.}

\subsection{Mirror Support Spine}

When the LTCC boxes were opened for refurbishment, the mirror support spine in all six Cherenkov detectors was
found to be broken. The spine was an aluminum honeycomb designed to prevent mirror deformation and misalignment
under their own weight. It was attached to the box nose and the back-wall. The support spine was rigid but its
attachment to the box failed to withstand deformations of the box (of the order of 0.5~cm) whenever the LTCC
modules were moved. A new carbon-fiber spine (see \F{spine}) was designed that is capable of floating up to 1~cm,
effectively compensating for any box deformations to the modules during transportation and installation. The
mirrors are linked to the spine through 0.127-mm thick stainless steel cables. The cables are anchored with stainless
steel springs with tension varying from 0.5 to 1~kg.

The spine was tested by mounting a laser on the box. The laser line was focused through the elliptical and hyperbolic
mirrors to a target in the middle of the covered face of a PMT. In order to verify that the detector transportation
and/or installation would not break the spine or affect the mirror alignment, the box was lifted, rotated back and
forth by 90\mdeg, and subjected to small vibrations. The focused spot on the PMT did not change with any of these
movements and the spine compensated for the box wall deformations.
