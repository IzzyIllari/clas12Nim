\subsection{The LTCC window}

The LTCC windows that cover the upstream and downstream open frame of the box is a composite of Tedlar/Mylar/Tedlar, see \F{windowDesign}. The Tedlar
material provides light tightness, while the Mylar adds the material strength necessary to withstand the gas pressure.

			Bottom: the seaming design involves gluing Mylar to Mylar to ensure that the window stress is transmitted entirely to the Mylar. }

The window was fabricated in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item lamination of Tedlar/Mylar/Tedlar rolls 1.6 m  wide
	\item seaming of the laminated strips into a square 23 m$^2$ window
\end{enumerate}

The solvent base adhesive lamination of 400 me of the composite material, with dimensions outlined in \F{windowDesign} (top) has been performed
at Madico \cite{madico}.


The 1.6 m wide windows are seamed together using G/Flex 655. The seam was load tested to withstand a pressure test 10 times
higher than the expected pressure from the gas flow and gas weight, see \F{windowTest}.


\begin{figure}

	\caption{The window was tested with up to 388 lbs of load. No significant damage was observed until rupture, which occurred at a load of 388 lbs,
			   corresponding to about 15,000 psi of stress on the window, about a factor of 10 higher than the stress during normal operations of the detector.}

\subsubsection{Windows installation and gas leaks tests}

The installation of the window onto the box was achieved through gluing the window on the box sides using G/Flex 655. The width of the window
attached with glue was 12 cm.
An example of the downstream window after installation is shown in \F{downstreamWindow}.

	\label{fig:downstreamWindow}
\end{figure}

After curing of both the upstream and downstream windows, the LTCC box was filled with nitrogen gas to a pressure of 2 inches of water.
Freon gas was pumped into the box and leaks were detected using a refrigerant leak detector. After the leaks were stopped, the box was pressurized
for a 48 hour period to test the overall box gas tightness. This procedure was repeated after every movement of the LTCC boxes, as small
shifts of the frame walls had the potential to introduce additional leaks.
