\subsection{Winston cones refurbishment}

Winston Cones (WC) are used to collect light onto the PMTs. In the LTCC there are three kind of WC:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Small
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Height: 18cm
		\item Parallel Plate distance: 14cm
		\item Radius at the top: 20cm
		\item Radius at the bottom: 11cm
		\item Material: copper (electro-formed)
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Medium
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Height: 22cm
		\item Parallel Plate distance: 15cm
		\item Radius at the top: 20cm
		\item Radius at the bottom: 11cm
		\item Material: 0.2‚Äù plastic (vacuum pressed)
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Large
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Height: 30cm
		\item Parallel Plate distance: 18cm
		\item Radius at the top: 22cm
		\item Radius at the bottom: 11cm
		\item Material: copper (electro-formed)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The reflectivity of the WC showed the same degradation as 
A setup on an optical bench allowed to measure the reflectivity for all the WCs at wavelengths between 200 and 400 nm was designed to accept incident light
shallow angles of 10-15 degrees (typical incident angle based on simulation studies), see \F{wcSetup}. A typical reflectivity of a poor WC is shown in \F{wcStatusBefore} (top).
All 216 WC were measured, and the results are shown in \F{wcStatusBefore} (bottom). This allowed to catalog the quality of the WC, as the
