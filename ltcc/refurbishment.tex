\section{LTCC Refurbishment}


The re-scoping of the LTCC to discriminate pions instead of electrons required a dramatic increase in the
number of photo-electrons detected. Four areas were considered to achieve this:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase optical reflectivity
	\item Increase PMT response to UV light
	\item Increase gas volume
	\item Address the gas leaks and other hardware issues.
\end{enumerate}


Monte-Carlo simulations of pions in the LTCC quantified the number of Cherenkov light  reflections on the cylindrical, elliptical,
parabolic, and Winston cones surfaces as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 2 reflections only: 30$\%$ of the time
	\item 3 reflections: 40$\%$ of the time
	\item 4 or more reflections: 30$\%$ of the time
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These results were confirmed with empirical observations during the mirror alignment.

A study of the refurbishment of the mirror and Winston cone surfaces
involved re-coating samples of the surfaces and mirrors using several companies.
The original average measured reflectivity of the mirrors and Winston cones
showed a degraded reflectivity compared to the values at installation and to
the new samples, likely due to  17 years of aging, see \F{reflectivityGain}.

\end{figure}

In the study a few scenarios using the $C_4F_{10}$ index of refraction (shown in \F{c4f10RefrIndex})
and considering the various reflection probabilities outlined above  were considered:

	\caption{The $C_4F_{10}$ gas index of refraction as a function of wavelength.}
	\label{fig:c4f10RefrIndex}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item using old or new mirror reflectivity (see \F{reflectivityGain});
	\item using a completely transparent gas or the $C_4F_{10}$ with its measured transparency;
	\item using the actual or the enhanced PMT quantum efficiency function;
	\item using or not the additional $C_4F_{10}$ gas volume;
	\item comparing the pion response to the original CLAS 6 GeV era electron response.
\end{itemize}

The results of these studies are discussed below.

The reflection probability vs wavelength distributions for each scenario were input into
the Frank\textendash Tamm formula \cite{Frank:1937fk} below to calculate
the Cherenkov radiation yield as a function of wavelength and momenta:

%~\ref{eq:cerenkov}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:cerenkov}
	\frac{d^2n}{dxd\lambda} = \frac{2\pi z^2\alpha}{\lambda^2}\sin^2{\theta_C(v)},
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\theta_C$ is the Cherenkov cone half-angle, $z$ is the particle charge and $v$ is its speed.

One particular combination among the described scenarios is given as an example \F{photonYieldStudy} for pions,
the measured non-refurbished mirror reflectivity, a 100$\%$ transparent gas, and a PMT with ideal refurbished quantum efficiency.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.98\columnwidth, height=0.75\columnwidth]{img/photonYieldStudy.png}
	\caption{Cherenkov light yield as a function of pion momentum and photon wavelength using the Frank\textendash Tamm formula
             for one of the scenarios considered: mirrors and Winston cones with low reflectivity (LTCC original mirror, not refurbished),
             a perfectly transparent gas and an ideally refurbished PMT.}
	\label{fig:photonYieldStudy}
\end{figure}


When the number of reflections is taken into account, the refurbishment shows
a factor of 2.5 gain in the visible light wavelengths and a factor of 3.8 in the UV:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Visible:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: 27.5$\%$
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: 68.1$\%$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ultra-violet:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: 9.1$\%$
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: 34.3$\%$
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


The results have been summarized in \F{refurbishmentGains} for the two main scenarios: mirror re-coating and PMT quantum efficiency improvements.
By performing both of these improvements, the study shows that the LTCC response to pions will be the same as it was for electrons above 4 GeV
in the original LTCC for CLAS.

             (squares). In addition, by increasing the PMT response to UV light (stars), the LTCC can reach the old
			 performance above pion momenta of 4 GeV.}

The design changes of the LTCC are summarized below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Resize the box to fit in the reduced space between the Drift Chambers and the Forward Time-Of-Flight:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cut Sides
		\item Relocate the three mirror sets closest to the back-wall
		\item Redesign, replace back-wall frame
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Decrease inefficient regions
	\item Increase PMT gain, split output to provide both FADC and TDC signals
	\item Minimize gas leaks
	\item Better mirror supports
	\item Increase light yield:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Re-coat all mirrors
		\item Re-coat Winston cones
		\item Wavelength shifting re-coating of the PMTs
		\item Modify small angle nose to increase gas volume
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
