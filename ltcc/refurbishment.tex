\section{LTCC Refurbishment}

The re-scoping of the LTCC to discriminate pions instead of electrons required a dramatic increase in the
number of photoelectrons detected. Four areas were considered to achieve this:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase optical reflectivity;
	\item Increase PMT response to ultraviolet (UV) light;
	\item Increase radiator gas thickness;
	\item Address the gas leaks and other hardware issues.
\end{enumerate}

Monte Carlo simulations of pions in the LTCC quantified the number of Cherenkov light  reflections on the cylindrical,
elliptical, parabolic, and Winston cone surfaces as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 2 reflections only: 30\% of the events;
	\item 3 reflections: 40\% of the events;
	\item 4 or more reflections: 30\% of the events.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These results were confirmed by measurements of the relative amount of laser light reflected by the
mirror surfaces to the face of the PMTs during the mirror alignment.

A study of the refurbishment of the mirror and Winston cone surfaces led to re-coating studies using
several vendor companies. The original average measured reflectivity of the mirrors and Winston cones
showed a degraded reflectivity when compared to the original values obtained at installation and to the
new coated samples, due to 17~years of aging, see \F{reflectivityGain}.

\end{figure}

In the study, a few scenarios using the C$_4$F$_{10}$ index of refraction (shown in \F{c4f10RefrIndex})
and considering the various reflection probabilities outlined above  were compared:

\begin{itemize}
	\item using old or new mirror reflectivity (see \F{reflectivityGain});
	\item using a completely transparent gas or the C$_4$F$_{10}$ with its measured transparency;
	\item using the actual or the enhanced PMT quantum efficiency function;
	\item using or not using the additional C$_4$F$_{10}$ gas volume;
	\item comparing the pion response to the original CLAS 6 GeV era electron response.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The results of these studies are discussed below.

The reflection probability vs. wavelength distributions for each scenario was input into the Frank\textendash
Tamm formula \cite{Frank:1937fk} to calculate the Cherenkov radiation yield as a function of wavelength and
momenta:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cerenkov}
  \frac{d^2n}{dxd\lambda} = \frac{2\pi z^2\alpha}{\lambda^2}\sin^2{\theta_C(v)},
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\theta_C$ is the Cherenkov emission angle, $z$ is the particle
charge, and $v$ is its speed.

          Tamm formula for one of the scenarios considered: mirrors and Winston cones with low reflectivity (LTCC
          original mirror, not refurbished), a perfectly transparent gas, and an ideally refurbished PMT.}

\end{figure}

The results of one particular combination among the described scenarios are given in \F{photonYieldStudy} for pions,
the measured non-refurbished mirror reflectivity, a 100\% transparent gas, and a PMT with ideal refurbished
quantum efficiency.

When the number of reflections is taken into account, the refurbished components provide a factor of 2.5 gain in
the visible light wavelengths and a factor of 3.8 in the UV range:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Visible light wavelength range:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: 27.5\%
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: 68.1\%
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ultraviolet light wavelength range:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: 9.1\%
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: 34.3\%
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

          be reached. More than a factor of two can be gained by re-coating the mirrors and Winston cones
          (squares). In addition, by increasing the PMT response to UV light (stars), the LTCC can now reach
          a performance for pions with momenta above 4~GeV that was achieved for electrons.}

\end{figure}

The results are summarized in \F{refurbishmentGains} for the two main scenarios: mirrors are re-coated and the
PMT quantum efficiency is improved. By performing both of these improvements, the study shows that the LTCC
response to pions will be the same as it was for electrons above 4~GeV in the original Cherenkov detector for CLAS.

The design changes of the LTCC are summarized below and discussed in the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Resize the box to efficiently fit in the space between the Drift Chambers and the Forward Time-Of-Flight
  counters:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Trim sides of the boxes
		\item Relocate the three mirror sets closest to the back-wall
		\item Redesign and replace the back-wall frame
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Decrease inefficient regions
	\item Increase PMT gain and split the output to provide both ADC and TDC signals
	\item Minimize gas leaks
	\item Improve the mirror supports
	\item Increase light yield:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Re-coat all mirrors
		\item Re-coat Winston cones
		\item Wavelength shifting re-coating of the PMTs
		\item Modify small angle nose to increase the gas volume
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
