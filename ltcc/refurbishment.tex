\section{LTCC Refurbishment}


The re-scoping of the LTCC to discriminate pions instead of electrons requires a dramatic increase in the
number of photo-electrons detected. Four areas have been considered to achieve this:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Re-coat all mirrors to increase their reflectivity
	\item Re-coat the Winston Cones to increase their reflectivity
	\item Wavelength shifting re-coating of the PMTs to increase the response to ultraviolet photons.
	\item Add “nose” to increase gas volume
\end{enumerate}


GEMC Simulations of pions quantify the Cherenkov light number of reflections on the cylindrical, elliptical,
parabolic and winston cones surfaces as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 2 reflections only: $30\%$ of the times
	\item 3 reflections $40\%$ of the times
	\item 4 or more reflections $30\%$ of the times
\end{enumerate}

The results have been confirmed empirically during the mirrors aligmnent.

The original average measured reflectivity of the mirrors and winston cones
shows a degraded reflectivity compared to the values at installation, probalby due to
17 years of aging, see Fig.~\ref{fig:reflectivityGain}.

A study of refurbishment of the mirrors and winston cones surfaces show a dramatic increase of
reflectivity. When the number of reflections are taken into account, the refurbishment shows
a factor of 2.4 gain in the visible and a factor of 3 in the UV:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Visible:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: $27.5\%$ (1 reflection $65\%$)
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: $68.1\%$  (1 reflection $88\%$ )
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}







The design changes of the LTCC are summarized below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Resize the box to fit in the reduced space between the Drift Chambers and the Time-Of-Flight:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cut Sides
		\item Relocate segments 16-17-18
		\item Redesign, replace back-wall frame
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Decrease inefficient regions.
	\item Increase PMT gain, split output to provide both FADC and TDC signals.
	\item Minimize gas leaks
	\item Better mirrors support
	\item Increase light yield:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Re-coat all mirrors
		\item Re-coat WCs
		\item Wavelength shifting re-coating of the PMTs
		\item Add “nose” to increase gas volume
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
