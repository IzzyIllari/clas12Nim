\section{LTCC Refurbishment}


The re-scoping of the LTCC to discriminate pions instead of electrons requires a dramatic increase in the
number of photo-electrons detected. Four areas have been considered to achieve this:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase optic reflectivity
	\item Increase PMTs response to UV light
	\item Increase gas volume
	\item Address the gas leaks and other hardware issues.
\end{enumerate}


GEMC Simulations of pions quantify the Cherenkov light number of reflections on the cylindrical, elliptical,
parabolic and winston cones surfaces as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 2 reflections only: $30\%$ of the times
	\item 3 reflections $40\%$ of the times
	\item 4 or more reflections $30\%$ of the times
\end{itemize}

The results have been confirmed with empirical observations during the mirrors aligmnent.

The original average measured reflectivity of the mirrors and winston cones
shows a degraded reflectivity compared to the values at installation, probably due to  17 years of aging, see Fig.~\ref{fig:reflectivityGain}.

A study of refurbishment of the mirrors and winston cones surfaces
involved re-coating samples of surfaces and mirrors using several companies.
All scenarios resulted in a dramatic increase of reflectivity. The original versus refurbished projected
reflectivity is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:reflectivityGain}.

		      by a new coating (red dots). }
	\label{fig:reflectivityGain}
\end{figure}

When the number of reflections are taken into account, the refurbishment shows
a factor of 2.4 gain in the visible and a factor of 3 in the UV:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Visible:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: $27.5\%$ (1 reflection $65\%$)
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: $68.1\%$  (1 reflection $88\%$ )
	\end{itemize}
	\item Ultra violet:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item original integrated reflectivity: $9.1\%$ (1 reflection $45\%$)
		\item refurbished integrated reflectivity: $34.3\%$  (1 reflection $75\%$ )
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The $C_4F_{10}$ reflectivity is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c4f10RefrIndex}. A detailed study of the detector response to electrons and pions used the Frank–Tamm to calculate
the Cherenkov radiation yield as a function of wavelengh and momenta, see for example Fig.~\ref{fig:photonYieldStudy}.

\caption{Cherenkov light yield as a function of pion momentum and photon wavelength. The study took into account: the mirror reflectivity; the number of reflections on the mirror and Winston Cones;
the gas refraction index and the gas reflectivity as a function of wavelength; the PMT quantum efficiency; different improvements to optics and PMTs response increase. }
	\label{fig:photonYieldStudy}
\end{figure}

The results have been summarize in Fig.~\ref{fig:refurbishmentGains} for two main scenarios: mirrors re-coating and PMT's quantum efficiency improvements.
By performing both of these improvements the study shows that the LTCC response to pions will be the same as it was for electrons above 4 Gev/c.

\caption{Ratio of LTCC response to pions to old response to electrons. Black diamonds: with no refurbishment, the goal of detecting pion cannot be reached.
          More than a factor of two can be gained by recoating the optics (blue squares). By also increasing the PMTs response to UV light (green stars), the
          LTCC can reach the old performance above pion momenta of 4 Gev / c.}

The design changes of the LTCC are summarized below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Resize the box to fit in the reduced space between the Drift Chambers and the Time-Of-Flight:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cut Sides
		\item Relocate segments 16-17-18
		\item Redesign, replace back-wall frame
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Decrease inefficient regions.
	\item Increase PMT gain, split output to provide both FADC and TDC signals.
	\item Minimize gas leaks
	\item Better mirrors support
	\item Increase light yield:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Re-coat all mirrors
		\item Re-coat WCs
		\item Wavelength shifting re-coating of the PMTs
		\item Add “nose” to increase gas volume
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
