\subsection{PMT Voltage Dividers}
\label{sec:dividers}

In the original readout electronics for CLAS, the single output from each PMT was amplified by a factor of 10 and then
split in two to feed the ADC and TDC boards. This amplification and splitting was performed by a dedicated electronics
module (UVA 132)~\cite{Adams:2001kk}. This unit was replaced by a pulse amplifier board entirely powered by the
current flowing through the base voltage divider. This board was developed in 2002 at JLab~\cite{Popov:2003mj}.

\noindent The new electronics provided a factor of 8 to 10 PMT signal boost, while preserving the fast PMT
pulse shape. It also significantly improved the signal amplitude and the signal-to-noise ratio: the high voltage needed
to detect the single photoelectron signal (SPE) was reduced on average by 374~V (see \F{pmtHVImprovement}).

	\caption{Comparison of the 36 PMT high voltages (in V) in one LTCC box gain-matched to provide a SPE peak at
          about ADC channel 200. The PMTs with the modified bases produce the same response function as the original
          base but at an average voltage 374~V less (1666~V vs. 1292~V).}

\end{figure}

The amplifier board design was adapted to use the LTCC XP4500B base and a prototype (shown in \F{pmtWithDivider})
was built to provide a factor of ten amplification and two identical output signals.

In \F{dividerTests} a comparison of the two signals shows the similarity between the two outputs. During testing of
the modified PMT bases, the output was processed by a flash ADC (FADC) read out by a data acquisition system using
the PMT itself as the trigger. The corresponding SPE spectrum was analyzed. The shape of the SPE signal is very
similar to the original signal coming from the external dedicated splitter and amplifier through the ADC electronics
shown in \F{dividerTests} (right).

180 bases were assembled at JLab and installed on the PMT dividers. Both signals from all of the modified bases
were tested. The response of the PMTs, amplified by a factor of about 10, was verified to be identical to the original
output.
