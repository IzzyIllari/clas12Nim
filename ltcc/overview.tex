\section{Overview}



\subsection{Original Design and Performance}

The CLAS Cherenkov detector~\cite{Adams:2001kk} has been instrumental in identifying electrons in the CLAS spectrometer during the Jefferson Lab 6 GeV era.
It provided electron/pion discrimination with $~90\%$ efficiency.

The system consists of six identical detectors, each containing:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 108 light-weight adjustable mirrors
	\item 36 Winston light collecting cones
	\item 36 5" Photonis X4500B PMTs
	\item 36 magnetic shields
\item $C_4F_{10}$ gas, refraction index: 1.00134
\end{itemize}


The optics of each module is designed to focus the light onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) associated with that module and located in the region
obscured by the CLAS torus magnet coils.
\F{optics} shows the optical arrangement of one module. The array of the modules in one sector is shown in \F{ltccArray}.

The detector was operational for about 17 years. The typical number of photo-electrons detected, coming from electrons, was between 10 and 20.
The PMT gain needed x10 multiplier electronics to be digitized by the ADCs and TDCs.
The detector had a few malfunctions: it was leaking gas at a rate of about $\$$50k/year, the mirror alignment had inefficiencies that affected
the signal strength, and the mirror supports were broken in all sectors.


\subsection{Upgrade}

With the higher beam energy of the upgraded accelerator~\cite{TDR12} the momentum of the particles increases substantially.
Given the pion Cherenkov threshold of 2.6 GeV, the detector cannot provide a good electron/pion discrimination for most energies and a new
High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC) with a $CO_2$ gas system has been built to provide electron discrimination up to momenta of 6 GeV.

The heavier $C_4F_{10}$ gas can still be used to discriminate pions from kaons (see \F{newScope}), thus the detector was refurbished
to a Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC).
The boxes have been modified to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support the new scope of pion/kaon discrimination
	\item Address the gas leaks and other hardware inefficiencies.
\end{itemize}

				The red coloring represents the case when only one particle give a distinctive signal in the LTCC, while the yellow coloring shows cases
            where more than one particle will release a signal. The pion/kaon discrimination is provided from about 3 to 8.5 GeV.}
