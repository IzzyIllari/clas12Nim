\subsection{Overview and Original Design}

The LTCC consists of six identical sectors, each containing:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 108 lightway adjustable mirrors
	\item 36 Winston light collecting Cones
	\item 36 5’’ Photonis X4500B PMT
	\item 36 Magnetic Shields
	\item C4F10 Gas, refraction index: 1.00134
\end{itemize}


The optics of each y module was designed to focus the light onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) associated with that module and located in the region obscured by the coils.
Fig.~\ref{fig:optics} shows the optical arrangement of one module. The array of the modules in one sector is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ltccArray}.
