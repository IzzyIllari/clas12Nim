\section{Overview}



\subsection{Original Design, Performance}

The CLAS Cherenkov detector~\cite{Adams:2001kk} has beemn instrumental in the electron identification during the CLAS6 era.
It provided eletron/pions discrimination up to the pion threshold of $2.6 Gev/c$ with $~90\%$ efficiency.

It consists of six identical sectors, each containing:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 108 Lightway adjustable mirrors
	\item 36 Winston light collecting Cones
	\item 36 5’’ Photonis X4500B PMT
	\item 36 Magnetic Shields
	\item C4F10 Gas, refraction index: 1.00134
\end{itemize}


The optics of each module is designed to focus the light onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) associated with that module and located in the region obscured by the coils.
Fig.~\ref{fig:optics} shows the optical arrangement of one module. The array of the modules in one sector is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ltccArray}.

The detector was operational for $~17$ years. The typical number of photo-electrons detected, coming from electrons, was between 10 and 20.
The PMT gain was low and a $x10$ multiplier was necessary. The signal was also split to provide both ADC and TDC outputs.

The detector also presented a few problems. It was leaking gas at a rate of about $\$50K$ / year and the mirrors alignment had malfunctions that affected
the signal strength.


\subsection{Upgrade}

With the higher beam energy of the upgraded accelerator~\cite{TDR12} the pion discrimination is being addressed
by the High Threshold Cherenkov counter with a $CO_2$ gas sytem that provides good electron discrimination up to momenta of $~6 GeV/c$.

The heavier $C_4F_{10}$ gas can still be used to discriminate pions from kaons, see Fig. ~\ref{fig:newScope} thus the detector was refusbished
to a Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC).

The box had to be modified so the

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support the new scope of pion/kaon discrimination
	\item .
	\item Address various problems with the original design.
\end{itemize}

	\caption{With the accelerator and CLAS12 upgrade, the momentum range of the detected particles has been extended significantly. While the HTCC
            provides the new electron/pion identification, the LTCC has been refusbished to provide a pion/kaon discrimination.}
