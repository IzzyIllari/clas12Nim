The CLAS Cherenkov threshold gas detector at Jefferson Lab was instrumental in the electron identification
in the 6 GeV era at Jefferson Lab.
The detector's scope has been modified to identify $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ for momenta
greater than 3.5 GeV/c, thus becoming a Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC).
This was accomplished with a refurbishment of the gas container, its windows,
the mirrors, the winston light collecting cones and the photo-multipliers.

The design, construction and performance of the refurbished LTCC is described.
The mirrors of lightweight and Winston cones have been re-surfaced with a high reflective coating.
The 5-in. photomultiplier tubes glasses have been treated with p-terphenyl to enhance the ultra-violet response.
The gas volume has been expanded to increase the number of photo-electrons.
Efficiencies and response functions have been measured.
