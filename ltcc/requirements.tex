\section{Requirements}

The LTCC requirements to allow for an adequate pion/kaon discrimination include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Maximizing the polar angle coverage in each of the six sectors up to angles of 30\mdeg;
	\item Minimizing the radiation length in the active area of CLAS12;
	\item Fitting the LTCC modules in the available space between the Drift Chambers~\cite{dc-nim} and the Forward
          Time-Of-Flight system~\cite{ftof-nim};
	\item Producing a signal for pions in the momentum range $4-8$~GeV.
\end{itemize}

The azimuthal and polar angle coverage achieved in the CLAS 6~GeV era was modified: the
distance between the target and the LTCC was increased by about 2~m in CLAS12. This brought some of the passive
elements of the LTCC into the active area of the detectors behind it, namely the support structure of the mirrors, the
Winston cones, the PMT magnetic shields, and the detector walls.

The radiation length of the detector was minimized in the original design by placing the light collecting cones and PMTs in the regions
obscured by the torus magnet coils. In the active area the window radiation length is 0.02\%. The remaining
requirements are addressed by the refurbishment and addressed in this paper.
