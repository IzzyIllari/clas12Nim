\section{Calibration}

The calibration of the LTCC detector consists of matching the gains of the 216 PMTs. The main reason for this
is that the FADC250 thresholds and sampling acquisition parameters are the same for all channels.

This gain calibration is carried out by using data with an electron beam incident on the experiment target. A
random trigger is saved in the data stream at a rate of 100~Hz. This data subset includes LTCC events with
PMT noise above the FADC pedestal, containing the single photoelectron signal (SPE).

At the beginning of each experiment the PMT high voltages are adjusted to align the peak positions to a particular
ADC value of $ADC_{SPE} = 200$. An example of the gain matching is shown in \F{gainMatching}. The ADC spectra
(see for \F{speCalibration} for typical histograms) are fit to identify the SPE peak positions. During analysis of
physics events, the reconstructed number of photo-electrons for the digitized ADC value is calculated to be
ADC/$ADC_{SPE}$.

          aligned at $ADC_{SPE} = 200$. Bottom: after gain matching the PMT responses are well aligned.}

          The SPE peak positions are fit with a Gaussian function and the mean $ADC_{SPE}$ parameters are recorded
          in the calibration database. The reconstructed number of photo-electrons for the digitized ADC value is
          ADC/$ADC_{SPE}$. Some anomalous PMTs can be seen: \#6 shows a larger than normal width (HV too large)
          and \# 15 shows a smaller than normal signal-to-noise due to a noisy PMT.}
