A ROOT-based system was developed to display integrated quantities from the CLAS Trigger system in the form of 1D
and 2D histograms. The system is made by three different applications: a histogram sender running on each VTP, a
histogram receiver running on a DAQ server, and a user-configurable GUI client. Each histogram sender application
defines a set of 1D and 2D histograms to report trigger data specific to the CLAS12 subsystem handled by the VTP it is
running on. Histograms are refreshed at a fixed rate and streamed to the DAQ server in the form of JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) messages, exploiting the previously described ActiveMQ infrastructure. Each message contains: the
histogram name, the number of bins, and a data array with the number of counts in each bin. The message receiver
application is responsible for decoding these messages, and of creating ROOT histograms from them. Finally, the client
application displays ROOT histograms to the user through a customizable GUI.

The GUI is composed of a programmable number of independent frames, with different histograms in each of them.
Typically, each frame contains histograms related to the same CLAS12 subsystem. The GUI structure is specified through
a configuration file passed as a command-line option when running the client. Communication between the message
receiver/ROOT histogram produced application and the user client is handled through the ROOT TSocket mechanism.
Figure~\ref{fig:plot_andrea} shows a GUI reporting histograms from the Forward Tagger system~\cite{ft-ref}: two
2D histograms showing the distribution of electromagnetic cluster hits in the Forward Tagger Calorimeter, and two
1D histograms showing the electromagnetic cluster energy distribution. The right (left) column reports histograms for
electromagnetic clusters  with (without) a matching hit in the Forward Tagger Hodoscope.

        detector~\cite{ft-ref}. The top histograms report the distribution of electromagnetic cluster hit positions, while
        the bottom histograms report the electromagnetic cluster energy distribution. The right (left) column reports
        histograms for electromagnetic clusters  with (without) a matching hit in the Forward Tagger Hodoscope.}
