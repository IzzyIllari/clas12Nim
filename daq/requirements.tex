\section{Requirements(Sergey)}

CLAS12 Data Aquisition System requirements were initially defined by electroproduction experiments as 10kHz event rate and 100MB/s data rate with livetime above 90\%. In a process of detector construction data rate requirement was upgraded to 200MB/s. Those requirements were never officially changed, however very first experiment shown that those requirements were too low. That situation was anticipated by developers and system is actially able to take data with event rate at least 20kHz and data rate at least 1GB/s which meets experiment demand at the moment of current publication. System has potential for futher performance increase as well.
