\section{Overview}

The CLAS12 Data Acquisition system (DAQ) collects data from the CLAS12 detector~\cite{overview-ref}. It is a
network-based system obtaining data from more than 100 front-end components comprising the trigger system signals,
assembling the component data into events, monitoring data quality, and recording data to tape. Typical event rates are
15-30~kHz and 500-1000~MByte/s with an acquisition livetime above 90\%. The CLAS12 DAQ software is written in
C/C++ as an expandable multi-threaded system, allowing relatively easy upgrades in case higher performance is required
or new components have to be included into the system. The CLAS12 DAQ has been successfully operated during the
first year of the CLAS12 experiment and expected to be used in the future with only minor modifications.
