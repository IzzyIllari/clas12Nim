\section{Overview}

The CLAS12 Data Aqcuisition System collects data from all CLAS12 detector components. It is network-based system collecting data from 100+ front-end components on trigger system signals, glueing components data into events, monitoring data quality and recording data to the tape. Typical rates are 15-20 kHz event rate and 500-1000 MByte/sec data rate with livetime above 90\%. CLAS12 DAQ written in C/C++ as expandable multi-threaded system allowing relatively easy upgrades in the case if higher performance is required, or new type of component have to be included into the system. CLAS12 DAQ used succesfully
during first year of CLAS12 operations and projected to be used for entire CLAS12 livespan with minimal changes.
