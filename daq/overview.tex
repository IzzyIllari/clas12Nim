\section{Overview}

The CLAS12 Data Aqcuisition System (DAQ) collects data from all CLAS12 detector components. It is a network-based system collecting data from more than 100 front-end components that comprise the trigger system signals, assembling the component data into events, monitoring data quality, and recording data to tape. Typical event rates are 15-20 kHz and 500-1000 MByte/sec with an acquisition livetime above 90\%. The CLAS12 DAQ software is written in C/C++ as an expandable multi-threaded system, allowing relatively easy upgrades in case higher performance is required, or new components have to be included into the system. The CLAS12 DAQ was used successfully during the first year of CLAS12 operations and is projected to be used for the entire CLAS12 life span with only minimal changes.
