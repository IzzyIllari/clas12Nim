\section{Performance}

The CLAS12 DAQ performance was adequate during the first year of running. Thanks to high trigger purity, the event rate never exceeded 20~kHz which was easily handled by the DAQ with livetime above 93\%. Data rate remains below 1000~MByte/sec (see Fig.~\ref{fig:runcontrol1}).

Several performance tests were conducted to check the data rate limits of the back-end components. With the front-end and Event Builder excluded, the Event Transfer and Event Recorder showed a data rate exceeding 2~Gbyte/sec on a single Dell R730 server. This demonstrates that the CLAS12 DAQ data rate limitation is much higher than required for all anticipated CLAS12 experiments.
