\section{Performance}(Sergey)

CLAS12 DAQ performance was adequate during first year of running. Thanks to high trigger purity event rate never exceeded 20kHz which was easily handled by DAQ with livetime above 93\%. Data rate stays within 1000MByte/sec, usually significantly lower (Fig.~\ref{fig:runcontrol1}).

Several performance tests were conducted to check data rate limits of the back-end components. With front-end and Event Builder excluded, Event Transfer and Event Recorder shown data rate exceeding 2Gbyte/sec on single DELL R730 server. That result displays that CLAS12 DAQ data rate limitation is much higher then it is required for anticipating CLAS12 experiments.
