\section{Conclusion}

The work on the CLAS12 DAQ system has started in 2008. The system has been designed and implemented in the years 2008 till 2017. The system has been successfully used during the phaseof development, tests and commissioning of all the CLAS12 detectors. In December 2017, the CLAS12 DAQ was ready for the first beam experiment and is in full operation mode since then. The CLAS12 DAQ achieved performance allows to use it without significant changes for the entire CLAS12 physics program.
