\section{Conclusion}

The work on the CLAS12 DAQ system started in 2008. The system has been designed and implemented in the years from 2008 to 2017. The system has been successfully used during the phase of development, testing and commissioning of all of the CLAS12 detectors. In December 2017, the CLAS12 DAQ was ready for the first beam experiment and has been in full operation mode since that time. The performance achieved by the CLAS12 DAQ allows it to be used without significant changes for the entire CLAS12 physics program.
