\section{Conclusions}

Work on the CLAS12 DAQ system started in 2008 with design and implementation carried out in the period from 
2008 to 2017. The system has been successfully used during the phase of development, testing, and commissioning of all
of the CLAS12 detectors. In December 2017, the CLAS12 DAQ was ready for the first beam experiment and has been
in full operation mode since that time. The performance achieved by the CLAS12 DAQ allows it to be used without
significant changes for the entire CLAS12 physics program.
