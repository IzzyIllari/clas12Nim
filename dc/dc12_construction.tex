\section{Chamber Construction}
\label{construction}
\subsection{Construction Overview}

The chambers were designed with individual holes and holders for
each wire, i.e. a ``strung'' rather than a ``wound'' chamber.  Our 
inspection and assembly procedures were designed to produce devices with 
wires placed and known by external survey to an accuracy of less than 1 mm. 
In addition to accuracy, we have chosen materials and designed 
procedures to insure a quiet and long-lived detector.  The construction 
and wire-stringing techniques were based on our already successful {\tt CLAS} 
drift chamber design.

The three chamber types (called ``regions'', with ``Region1'' abbreviated as 
``R1'', etc.)  share the same basic design elements simply
scaled up in size by a factor of 1.5 for R2 relative to R1 and a factor
of 2 between R3 and R1.  
Each chamber is a solid trapezoid in shape, with  
a pair of wire-supporting endplates that bear both the load of the 
wire tensions and the weight of all associated hardware. A representative 
chamber is shown in Fig.~\ref{chamber-exploded}, with parts indicated.
This particular drawing is of a R1 chamber, but all chambers have the
same basic parts.

The chamber bodies were constructed from the accurately machined plates
(2 endplates, a ``nose plate'' and a ``back plate'').
The endplates themselves were an assembly of a basic plate with precision-drilled
holes to which we bolted and glued stiffener bars.  In the case of
R1 the plate was aluminum and the stiffener bars were stainless steel;
for R2 the plates were G10 and the bars stainless steel and for R3
the plates were an assembly of thin steel plates with a foam interior.

At the radially outward end of each chamber, a thick ``back-plate'' was 
employed to maintain the relative 
alignment of the endplates, to stiffen the chamber against bending moments, 
and to provide a place to attach gas seals and fittings. At the radially inward 
end of each chamber, the endplates were connected together via a small joining 
piece called the ``nose-plate''.  The hardware fabrication and placement 
was of critical importance to the dimensional accuracy of the chambers.

\subsection{Endplate Design and Construction}

As noted above our chambers have wires strung from one endplate to 
the other.  Holes are drilled into the endplates into which are
placed feedthrough assemblies meant to hold the wire end.
Each endplate was constructed with 4928 accurately positioned holes into 
which the 
wire-fixture assemblies were placed.  The sense, field, and guard wires in each 
sector were strung between pairs of wire ``feedthroughs''.  As the endplates of 
each chamber faced each other at a 60$^{\circ}$ angle, the wires had to bend 
30$^{\circ}$ at each endplate.  This was accomplished by means of a large radius 
stainless-steel insert at the tip of each feedthrough known as a ``trumpet''.
This trumpet was fitted into an injection-molded Noryl plastic feedthrough.  
All wires were held in place using gold-plated copper crimp pins.  
Low-outgassing epoxy was employed to ensure a gas seal around the feedthroughs 
and crimp pins.

boards.

\subsubsection{Inspection and Cleaning}

A visual and tactile inspection was performed on the endplates and 
structural frame upon delivery.  The endplates and structural 
frame underwent a gross cleaning by soaking in a low residue laboratory 
degreasing solution with hand scrubbing, followed by a high-pressure water 
rinse. The parts then received their final cleaning using an ultrasonic 
bath of a laboratory-grade detergent solution.  After two hours they were
removed from the bath and rinsed with de-ionized water and then sprayed 
with methanol to aid drying. Once dry, the parts were heat-sealed in nylon 
bags with a nitrogen atmosphere to await assembly.

Smaller parts such as feedthroughs and hardware were cleaned using a 
bench-top ultrasonic cleaner with laboratory detergent, followed by a 
de-ionized water rinse and a dousing of methanol to facilitate drying.  
In addition, the injection-molded parts are specified to be free of silicon 
mold releases.



\subsection{Wire Choice}
\hskip 0.15in
Our ``thin endplate'' design required minimizing wire tensions and
thus diameter of the wire.  The real key to reducing wire tension is to
make the field wires (which are much larger than the sense wires) as 
thin as possible and to make them out of low-density metal.  In this 
section we describe our choices for sense, field and guard wires.
We had to trade off the robustness and more uniform drift velocity
afforded by large diameter sense wire with the disadvantages that they
required higher voltages to reach the same gas gain; 
a potential problem for our high-density signal amplifier boards.

In general, designers have chosen very small diameter sense wires because they
require lower operating voltates.
The sense wire for all of our chambers, supplied by the Luma
Sweden Company, consists of 30-$\mu$m diameter gold-plated tungsten.  
The previous CLAS drift chambers used 20-$\mu$m diameter wire for the
sense wires.  We decided to use the thicker 30-$\mu$m wire for two 
reasons: first, it is significantly tougher making it easier to handle without
accidental kinking and less likely to break, and second, to operate at the same 
gas gain as chambers with the thinner wire requires a high voltage setting 
(approximately 300 V higher) and this results in a higher field throughout the cell
and a more linear drift velocity function.  

Tungsten was chosen because of its durability, 
and the gold-plating of the wires, amounting to a thickness of 0.127~$\mu$m, 
ensures chemical inertness as well as a smooth surface finish.  The expected 
electronics gain and thresholds dictated that the gas gain be a few times 
10$^4$.  Under this condition, the electric field at the surface of the sense 
wires is $\approx$200~kV/cm.  

We chose 80-$\mu$m gold-plated Cu-Be wire for our field wire and
140-$\mu$m gold-plated Cu-Be wire for our guard wires; both supplied
by Little Falls Alloys.
Cu-Be wire is very tough, is easily plated and resists ``flaking'' of the gold
plating. 
Minimizing the diameter for the field wire is important because it means that they 
could be strung at lower tension than a thicker wire for the same gravitational sag.  
This minimizes the forces on the endplates which we wanted to keep as 
thin as possible to maximize the solid-angle of the sensitive area of
the chambers.

The 80-$\mu$m diameter was chosen because it is the smallest possible choice
which will not initiate cathode emission at the surface.
At our operating conditions, the surface field at the field wire
surface is less than 50~kV/cm, and this will minimize 
conditions which could cause unwanted cathode emissions and a noisy chamber.  
We note that
our choice violated the ``20~kV/cm rule'', the conventional wisdom that
a surface field greater than $20 kV/cm$ an the cathode wire would lead to 
a noisy chamber.
Our own studies (RSef~\cite{cathode-emission}) showed that there was no cathode
emission below 50~kV/cm from any wire with good surface finish.  Each batch
of wire was tested with our test device (Ref~\cite{patent}) to ensure that at operating field 
values there was no emission.  

\subsubsection{Wire Tensions}
A basic principle of our drift chamber design is that each drift cell is a perfect hexagon.
We used this geometrical constraint to determine the hole placement in the endplates.
This geometrical design assumed that wires are straight lines.  Of course, real wires
sag across the wire span due to gravity.  To keep our perfect hexagonally-shaped cells,
we tensioned our three types of wires (sense, field and guard) such that they
{\bf sagged equally} under their gravitational loads.

Our 30$\mu$m Tungsten sense wires, 80$\mu$m Cu-Be field wires and 140$\mu$m Cu-Be guard
wires had linear densities of .014, .042 and .129 g/m, respectively.  To sag equally
under gravity, they were strung at 20, 62 and 190 g of tension, respectively.
In each chamber there were 12 rows of 112 sense wires, 28 rows of 112 field wires
and 4 rows of 112 guard wires for a total wire tension of 306 Kg.
This caused some bowing of our thin endplates.  This bowing and the sagging
of the wires themselves is discussed in the section on geometrical distortions,
section\ref{geom_distortions}.

\subsection{Construction Materials}

\hskip 0.15 in
To insure that the drift chambers perform well for 10 years or more, care was taken to 
specify that all materials in contact with the gas volume were clean and ``chamber 
safe'' as defined in Ref~\cite{kadyk}.  All construction was carried out in 
Class-10000 or better clean rooms.

The drift-chamber frames were made primarily of aluminum (R1), fiberglass (R2),
or steel-clad structural foam (R3).  The aluminum and steel endplates were 
manufactured with machine oils and were subsequently cleaned with  
Micro-laboratory detergent from the Cole-Parmer Instrument Company.  The 
fiberglass endplates were machined without any lubricating oils.  Immediately 
prior to chamber assembly all endplates were sequentially cleaned with 
detergent,
 deionized water, and alcohol, and then blown dry with pure nitrogen gas.  The 
wire feedthroughs, trumpets, and crimp pins were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath 
with detergent and then rinsed in a second ultrasonic bath with deionized water.

During construction three different types of epoxy were used in areas exposed 
to the chamber gas.  Shell Epon resin 826 mixed with Versamid 140, and 
Scotchweld varieties 210 and 2216 were employed.  These mixtures have been 
studied extensively and found not to outgas significantly~\cite{nasa}.

The on-chamber gas tubing employed is mainly stainless steel, with some
nylon tubing included for gas manifolds.  Special care was taken during
all steps of construction and testing to ensure that no oils or
silicones contacted any of the chamber materials.

\subsection{Chamber Wire Stringing}


Because all of the chambers have the same shape, differing only in
size and some materials, we strung them all using the same basic method.
They were gravity-strung using the same basic methodology 
used when stringing the previous {\tt CLAS} drift chambers.  The detector box 
assembly was mounted to a stringing fixture.  The frame was connected to 
the fixture using attachments that allow the chambers to rotate along 
the center of mass.  This permitted safe and easy 
rotation of the detector by hand.  A gantry crane was used to lift the 
detector onto and off the stringing fixture and to raise the small end of 
the detector to account for the stereo angles.

The stringing fixture was mounted to the floor using 
concrete anchors.  This minimized floor obstruction as the box must be 
rotated to the opposite side to string the second set of wires.  The box 
and frame assembly were placed far enough away from the uprights such that 
they did not interfere with stringing activities.  There was a gross 
adjustment using 
the gantry crane to lift the telescoping side and pin it on the adjustment 
collar.  The collar had a fine adjustment to allow setting it at the most 
favorable stringing angle.  The detector box was rotated 180$^\circ$ to 
string the second superlayer.

Once the detector was installed onto the fixture, wire feedthrough 
insulators were inserted and glued into each hole. Special care was 
taken to use only the minimal amount of glue required to provide a solid gas 
seal and to prevent glue contamination inside the detector.  Once one 
endplate was filled, the assembly was rotated such that the other side 
could be done.  Once all wire feedthrough inserts were in place, the box 
was pre-tensioned.

With nearly 130,000 wires to be threaded through the chambers and only 2 years 
for construction, it was important to minimize the time required to string 
each wire.  All chambers were strung with 
the wires running vertically.  The stringing technique involved attaching a 
small steel needle to the wire before threading it through the feedthrough in 
the upper endplate.  The wire was then despooled and gravity acted to bring the 
wire close to the feedthrough in the lower endplate.  A small magnet was then 
used to pull the needle and wire through the lower feedthrough.  After the upper 
crimp pin was attached and crimped and the remaining slack in the wire was removed, the lower 
crimp pin was slid over the wire and stringing weights were attached to the wire to set the 
proper tension.  The lower crimp pin was then crimped, completing the process.
  
Wires that wrapped around each other while being threaded through the chamber 
were a major contribution to stringing inefficiency. To avoid the wrapping
problem, a machine was built to spool the wire through the chambers quickly and smoothly.
Another important development was the design of a crimp pin 
that accepted both the tungsten and copper-beryllium wire types.  Using a 
thick-walled 
copper pin ensured a good crimp through a range of gap settings~\cite{sbc}.  This 
eliminated the need to use separate crimping tools, each requiring frequent 
calibrations.  This was possible because the wire position was determined by the 
radius of the trumpet at the end of the feedthrough inside of the chamber, and 
not by the concentricity of the pin, feedthrough, and endplate-hole diameters. 
As a result, the average time to string a wire was less than 4 minutes.
