\begin{abstract}
The CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer built for the 12~GeV upgrade of Jefferson Lab
(CLAS12) is located in Hall~B and is built around a superconducting toroidal magnet. The six coils
of this toroid divide the detector azimuthally into six sectors.  Each sector contains three multi-layer 
drift chambers for reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles originating from a fixed target.  

Each of the 18 planar chambers has two ``superlayers'' of six layers each, with the wires in the two adjacent
superlayers oriented at $\pm 6^{\circ}$ stereo angle, respectively. Each layer has 112 hexagonal cells
spanning a range from about $5^{\circ}$ to $40^{\circ}$ in polar angle. The six-layer structure provides
redundancy in track segment finding and good tracking efficiency even in the presence of some individual
wire inefficiency.  The design, construction, operation, and calibration methods are described, and estimates
of efficiency and resolution are presented from in-beam measurements.
