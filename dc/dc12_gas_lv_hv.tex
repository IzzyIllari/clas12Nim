\section{Drift Chamber Utilities: Gas, Low Voltage, and High Voltage Systems}
\label{utilities}

\subsection{Gas System: Mixing, Monitoring, and Pressure Control}

The chambers operate on a gas mixture consisting of 90\% argon and 10\% CO$_2$.
Using precision mass flow controllers (MFCs), the gas is mixed and temporarily
stored in large-volume buffer tanks.  From these tanks it is delivered
to experimental Hall B.  

Argon is supplied via boil-off from a large, permanent dewar and CO$_2$ is supplied 
via boil-off from several standard industry high-pressure dewars. Two identical mixing
systems are used to mix the gas to 90\% argon and 10\% CO$_2$ by mass using regulators and MKS G250 
MFCs. The mixed gas is then stored at 100~psig in four large-volume 
ASME pressure vessels, also called buffer tanks. This large volume smooths out 
any minor fluctuations in the argon/CO$_2$ ratio. To control the gas ratio, the thermal 
conductivity of the gas ratio is continually measured using Panametrics Thermal 
Conductivity Units (TCUs) and then matched to the thermal conductivity of a mixed 
gas calibration standard. Individual MFC flows are adjusted as needed if the gas mixture
ratio changes. The mixed gas is supplied to the hall via two similar gas delivery systems, 
one for R3 and one for the combined flow through R1 and R2. 
We flow gas into the chambers at a rate of $\sim$2 - 3 volume exchanges per day;
amounting to 36~l/min for the R3 chambers, 18~l/min for the R2 chambers, and 7~l/min
for the R1 chambers.

MFCs and pressure regulators set the gas flow and pressure from the 
buffer tanks to the supply manifolds in the hall. In the hall, flow control for each 
individual sector is set using rotameters located at the supply manifolds. The gas flows 
into each detector at the nose and exits out of the backplate and into the exhaust 
manifolds. Since the gas volumes of R1 + R2 are about half the gas volume of R3, the R1 and R2 exhaust 
through one manifold and R3 exhausts through its own manifold. The exhaust manifolds 
are connected to pressure relief systems. 

The drift chambers use thin, aluminized Mylar windows with a large surface area.  
Any over-pressure event could cause the windows to burst. Likewise, an under-pressure 
event could cause damage to the wires inside.  Due to the potential of catastrophic 
damage to the detectors in the case of an over-pressure or under-pressure event, 
passive relief systems (bubblers) are installed on each exhaust manifold. In an 
over-pressure situation (i.e. high differential pressure between the exhaust manifold 
and atmosphere), the gas in the detector is vented out until the differential pressure 
falls to a safe level. In an under-pressure situation (i.e. low differential pressure 
between the exhaust manifold and atmosphere), air is sucked into the exhaust manifold 
until the differential pressure increases to a safe level. Each of these high-flow 
differential pressure relief systems consist of 3 parts:  an oil-filled over-pressure 
bubbler, an oil-filled under-pressure bubbler, and an empty oil trap, all filled
with high-purity mineral oil.  The oil trap is 
connected to the exhaust manifold, while the over- and under-pressure bubblers are 
connected directly to the oil trap. This prevents contaminating the exhaust manifolds
with oil. Additionally, each of the 3 parts contain baffles to remove oil droplets 
from the gas passing through the unit. 

Figure~\ref{dc-gas-system} shows a schematic of the gas delivery system 
and a snapshot of the control panel for monitoring the state of the system.
The figure illustrates a typical running condition where water infiltration
is less than a hundred ppm and oxygen infiltration less than a few hundred ppm.
These levels should negligibly affect signal size; for example, see Ref.~\cite{oxygen-contamination}
for a discussion of the effects of Oxygen contamination.

\subsection{Low Voltage System}

We reused the CLAS low voltage power supplies; see Ref.~\cite{dcnim} for details.  
The supplies are remotely programmable and monitored.  The on-chamber 
preamplifiers require 6~V and 18~A per chamber to the STB regulators,
(a total of 1344 preamps per chamber).  

We isolated the low voltage from 
ground loops by using local voltage regulators on the preamplifier interface 
boards (STBs).  The segmentation of the low voltage distribution cables is 
based on 32 preamplifier channels per supply cable.  Each of the supply 
cables is fused for over-current 
protection based on the average current draw of 32 preamplifiers.  

We designed our low voltage system (supplies, fusing, cables, and control
system) to be as robust and maintenance-free as possible.  To minimize
the damage to the tracking system in the event of a failure such as
a shorted preamplifier, we built in fine segmentation with only
32 preamplifier channels per supply cable. 
In the event of a short circuit that causes a fuse to blow,
a simple, external cable disconnect will reduce the size of the affected
area to 16 signal wires without the need to access the chambers.

Figure~\ref{dc-lv-system} shows a schematic of the low voltage
supply system and a snapshot 
of the control panel for monitoring the state of the system.

\subsection{High Voltage System}

As in the case of the low voltage system, we designed our high voltage system
(supplies, distribution boxes, cables, and control system) to be as robust and 
as maintenance-free as possible.  
We reused our CAEN 
system 527 high voltage supplies with somewhat finer segmentation than our 
previous system, consistent with our total channel count dropping from 34000 
to about 24000.
To minimize the damage to the tracking system in the event of a failure such as
a broken wire, we built in very fine segmentation.
Each individual high voltage channel powers a variable-sized group of 
wires: a 48-wire group for wires in the small-angle region, a 96-wire group
in the middle-angle region, and a 192-wire group at large angles.

In the event of a failure (e.g. a broken wire) that results in a trip
of a single HV channel, we can further reduce the size of the affected
area from the whole group (48, 96, or 192 wires) to a smaller grouping
of 48 wires by an external cable disconnect without the need to 
physically access the chambers themselves.

The high voltage supply and distribution system consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a crate-based high voltage power supply with 36 independent
high voltage channels for each drift chamber (1344 signal wires each).
Of these 36 channels, 16 supply positive high voltage to the sense
wires, 16 supply negative voltage to the field wires, and 4 supply
positive voltage to the guard wires;
\item a series of two distribution boxes that distribute the high
voltage from the supply channels to variable-sized groups
of wires, with the group size being 48 wires (for small angle wires)
to 96 (intermediate angles) to 192 (large angles);
\item  on-chamber printed circuit boards that distribute high voltage
to all of the wires; these are the HVTBs.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{dc-hv-system} is a schematic of the high voltage
supply system and a snapshot 
of the control panel for monitoring the state of the system.
There are 648 individual remote-controlled high voltage channels
shown.  In this particular snapshot, two channels are colored
red (or darker) to indicate a high voltage trip for the sense
and field wires for Sector 2, R2, superlayer 1, wires 32-48.
The fact that the adjacent sense and field wire channels both
tripped indicates that there was an over-current condition for
this group of wires with current probably flowing from field to
sense wire; i.e. likely over-current in the chamber itself.
This happens occasionally when the beam is mis-steered, causing
higher than normal background radiation.
