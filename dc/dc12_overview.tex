\section{Forward Tracking System}
\label{overview}

The CLAS12 Forward Detector is constructed around a toroidal magnet consisting of six 
iron-free superconducting coils.  The particle detection system consists of drift 
chambers to determine charged-particle trajectories, Cherenkov detectors 
for electron/pion separation, scintillation counters for flight-time 
measurements, and calorimeters to identify electrons and high-energy neutral 
particles.  An overview of the CLAS12 subsystems and geometry may be found in the 
CLAS12 Overview paper~\cite{clas12-nim} in this volume.  A schematic view of the 
torus magnet with drift chambers
attached is shown in Fig.~\ref{chambers-and-torus}.   The drift chambers are 
triangular boxes attached to the magnet cryostat.  
This assembly of the magnet and chambers is referred to as the ``Forward Tracker''. 

The Forward Tracker can detect charged particles emerging from the target with
momenta greater than 200~MeV at polar angles from roughly 5$^{\circ}$ to 
40$^{\circ}$.  Particles with lower momentum are swept out of the tracking
volume by the torus magnetic field.  
Because the coils of the torus magnet represent a ``dead area''
in which we cannot detect charged particles, we designed the chamber endplates
and attached electronics to be as thin as possible.  The resulting azimuthal
coverage varies from 50\% of 2$\pi$ at 5$^{\circ}$ to 80\% of 2$\pi$ at 40$^{\circ}$.
