\section{Forward Tracking System}
\label{overview}

The CLAS12 forward detector is constructed around a toroidal magnet consisting of six 
iron-free superconducting coils.  The particle detection system consists of drift 
chambers to determine charged-particle trajectories, {\v C}erenkov detectors 
for electron/pion separation, scintillation counters for flight-time 
measurements, and calorimeters to identify electrons and high-energy neutral 
particles.  An overview of the CLAS12 subsystems and geometry may be found in the 
CLAS12 Overview section.  A schematic view of the torus magnet with drift chambers
attached is shown in Fig.~\ref{chambers-and-torus}.   This assembly is referred to
as the ``forward tracker''. 

The forward tracker can detect charged particles emerging from the target with
momenta greater than 200~MeV/c over a polar angular range from roughly 5$^{\circ}$ to 
40$^{\circ}$.  Because the coils of the torus magnet represent a 'dead area'
in which we cannot detect charged particles, we designed the chamber endplates
and attached electronics to be as thin as possible.  The resulting azimuthal
coverage varied from 50\% of 2$\pi$ at 5$^{\circ}$ to 80\% of 2$\pi$ at 40$^{\circ}$.

The requirements of the planned physics experiments drove the conceptual design
of the chambers; those requirements and engineering considerations led to 
the final design and construction of the chambers, as discussed in the next section.
