\subsection{Region Three Construction}

\hskip 0.15 in
The R3 chambers were designed and constructed at Jefferson Laboratory.  
They had the same general shape as the other chambers but were larger,
4 m on a side so the wires were as long as 4 m.
To reduce the gravitational sag of these very long wires we
strung them at 40 grams, twice the nominal tension of 20 grams.

Because these are the final tracking chambers, multiple scattering
at the chamber entrance is not as important as multiple scattering that
occurs at a R1 or a R2 chamber, for example.  This allowed us to 
build a chamber in which the endplates were not supported only on
their ends.  At the entrance face we included 7 thin-walled Carbon
fiber tubes to span the gap and hold the endplates apart.  At the
exit face the endplates were coupled to a triangular carbon-foam-carbon
composite plate which similarly supported the wire tension.
