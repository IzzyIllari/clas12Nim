\section{Drift Chamber Electronics}
After the drift chambers were built and the wires strung, we mounted
on-chamber printed circuit boards onto the chamber endplates.
The signal connections to the wires are made through printed-circuit 
boards mounted along one side of each chamber, called Signal Translator 
Boards (STBs).  These boards are responsible for signal routing and 
pre-amplification.  

On the opposite side of each sector, another set of 
circuit boards called the High Voltage Translator Boards (HVTBs) is used 
to make the high-voltage connections to the wires (see the subsection
on gas, low voltage and high voltage for more details on the high
voltage system).

The drift chamber signal amplification and readout consists of the 
following subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
\item  chamber-mounted printed circuit boards with a single in-line package
(SIP) amplifier for each signal wire; these are the STB's
\item  chamber printed circuit boards which distribute high voltage
to all of the wires; these are the HVTB's
\item a single 17-pair twisted-pair readout cable for each group of 16
SIP's, and
\item a 96-channel drift chamber readout board (DCRB) for each group
of 6 cables (96 signal wires)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{On-Chamber PCBs and Cables}

The circuit boards that interface the sense 
wires to the pre-amplifiers (STBs) were  
designed for a 96-channel format.  This format allows for only seven 
circuit boards for each superlayer.   Fig.~\ref{r1stb} shows the traces 
routed from the signal pick-up at the plated-through holes to the signal 
inputs of the pre-amplifier.

The heart of the STB board is an individually packaged
single in-line package (SIP) preamplifer which was modified
from the design of the previous CLAS detectors and 
included an epoxy resin encapsulation.  
The encapsulation of the components was included to prevent 
component corrosion in a somewhat humid environment (relative
humidities as high as 60\%).
These ``CP01'' pre-amplifiers provide the gain, dynamic range, rise time, low 
noise, and low power needed for the performance requirements. 

Each SIP operates at 6V and draws about ??? amps.  For safety 

Each group of 16 pre-amplifier signals were routed to a 16-pin connector.
Signals were routed from the STB's to the drift chamber readout boards (DCRB)
over individual cables consisting of 16 twisted pairs.  We chose
twisted-pair readout because of its immunity to electronic noise.
The cables are round-jacketed with a 
0.025-in pitch so that the overall cable dimension is smaller than the 
standard 17-pair cable.  

\subsection{Off-Chamber Amplification, Time Digitization and Readout}

Our on-chamber 
pre-amplifiers send signals to the readout boards (DCRB) 
which provide another level of amplification, 
signal discrimination adjustable threshold setting, time digitization
and readout. 

These DCRB's are based on FPGA technology, and in addition to
their primary function of amplification, discrimination, digitization
and readout, they are used in a simple ``cluster-finding'' algorithm
to find track segment candidates with a latency of only hundreds
of nanoseconds.
