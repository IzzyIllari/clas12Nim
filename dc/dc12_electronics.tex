\section{Drift Chamber Electronics}
In this section we describe the drift chamber electronics:
the on-chamber signal distribution and amplification boards which
we named ``Signal Translator Boards'', (STB),
the on-chamber high voltage translator boards (HVTB) and the
off-chamber drift chamber readout boards (DCRB).

On one endplate of each chamber is a set of High-Voltage Distribution Boards (HVTB's)
which distributes RC-filtered high voltage to the wires.  Because there are three
types of wire, `sense', `field' and `guard', we supply three different voltages
to each HVTB board.  

On the other side of the chamber are Signal Translator Boards (STB) 
which support an individual Single Inline Package (SIP) transimpedance
pre-amplifier which is capacitively coupled to each sense wire since the
sense wires are at high voltage.  This pre-amplifier takes the
small current pulse (as small as a few microAmps) and translates it into a voltage 
pulse with a transimpedance of 2 mV/$\mu$A.  The signals (typically
10's to 100's of mV and 10's to 100's of nanosecond duration) are
transmitted down (17-pair) twisted-pair cables to our downstream
Drift Chamber Readout Boards (DCRB) which further amplify and
discriminate the voltage pulses and then convert the leading edge
to a digital time signal.


The drift chamber signal amplification and readout system consists of the 
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item  chamber-mounted printed circuit boards with a single in-line package
(SIP) amplifier for each signal wire; these are the STB's (one type for each superlayer)
\item  chamber-mounted printed circuit boards which distribute high voltage
to all of the wires; these are the HVTB's (one type for each superlayer)
\item a single 17-pair twisted-pair readout cable for each group of 16
SIP's, and
\item a 96-channel drift chamber readout board (DCRB) for each group
of 6 cables (96 signal wires)
\end{itemize}

Table ~\ref{electronic-components} gives a channel count for our chamber-mounted electronic components.

\subsection{Signal Translator Boards (STB) and High Voltage Translator Boards (HVTB)}

The high voltage side of each chamber was tiled with 14  multi-layered printed circuit 
boards called High Voltage Translation Boards (HVTBs).  Although simple in design,
the HVTB's were designed to distribute three separate voltages to the Sense, Field
and Guard wires, respectively.  See section \ref{set-operating-parameters} for a 
description of how we determined the operating values of the high voltage.  
Each high voltage line on the HVTB was connected to the 
input high voltage wire with a parallel RC circuit to absorb any AC noise on
the lines.  The board layout is shown in Fig.~\ref{hvtb-layout}.

The signal side of each chamber was tiled with 14 multi-layered printed circuit 
boards called Signal Translation Boards (STBs).  These boards were  
built in a 96-channel format, which requires seven 
circuit boards for each superlayer (672 signals).   The boards  
capacitively decoupled high voltage from the signals, and then routed 
the signals to the single in-line package (SIP) transimpedance pre-amplifiers 
mounted on the boards.  The amplified differential signals are then sent 
via 20-m long twisted-pair lines to the main {\tt CLAS12} readout electronics.

The connections between the sense-wire crimp pins and the plated-through holes 
of the STB boards were made using short conductive-elastomer tubes.  This material 
consists of silver-plated and/or nickel-plated glass spheres embedded in a 
silicon-rubber matrix.  These tubes pass through the plated-through hole and 
over the end of the crimp pins, making the electrical contract between the 
wire and the circuit board.  A small plastic cap inserted into the end of the 
tube ensures good contact with the circuit board.  This approach has the 
advantages of reducing the space needed for connections, preventing crimp pins 
from being pulled from the feedthroughs when disconnecting the boards from the 
wires, and reducing the cost compared to metal connectors.  This detail is 
shown in Fig.~\ref{wire-to-amplifier}.

crimp pin to the pre-amplifier.  }}

Fig.~\ref{stb-layout} shows the layout of an STB board,
including the trace routings from the capacitively-coupled
wire signal to the Single In-Line Package (SIP) preamplifier, and the
placement of the SIP's into groups of 16 with the SIP outputs being
routed to the 16-pin signal connectors.  Also shown are the low-voltage
power traces with individual fuses for each group of 16 wires.
The board shown is from a R1 chamber which had the tightest wire packing.

\subsubsection{Single In-line Package (SIP) Preamplifiers}
The heart of the STB board is an individually packaged
single in-line package (SIP) preamplifer which was modified
from the design of the previous CLAS detectors and 
included an epoxy resin encapsulation.  
The encapsulation of the components prevents 
component corrosion in a somewhat humid environment (relative
humidities as high as 60\%).
These ``CP01'' pre-amplifiers provide the gain, dynamic range, rise time, low 
noise, and low power needed for the performance requirements.  The CP01 is
a transimpedance amplifier with a gain of 2 mV/$\mu$A and a rise-time
less than 10 ns.  Each SIP operates at 6V and draws about 13 mA.   

Fig.~\ref{CP01-description} shows the design and specifications of the
CP01 pre-amplifier.  See Ref.~\cite{fjb92} for the original design of
this SIP pre-amplifier.

Each group of 16 pre-amplifier output signals was routed to a 17 pair connector.
Sixteen of the pairs are used as differential signal paths which are routed from the STB's to the 
drift chamber readout boards (DCRB) over individual cables consisting of 16 twisted pairs.  
We chose
twisted-pair readout because of its immunity to electronic noise.
The cables are round-jacketed with a 
0.025-in pitch so that the overall cable dimension is smaller than the 
standard 17-pair cable.  

\subsection{Off-Chamber Amplification, Time Digitization and Readout}

Our on-chamber 
pre-amplifiers send signals to the readout boards (DCRB) 
which provide another level of amplification, 
signal discrimination, adjustable threshold setting, time digitization
and readout. 

These DCRB's are based on FPGA technology, and in addition to
their primary function of amplification, discrimination, digitization
and readout, they are used in a simple ``cluster-finding'' algorithm
to find track segment candidates with a latency of only hundreds
of nanoseconds.

\subsubsection{Drift Chamber Readout Boards (DCRB)}

The DCRB is a 96 channel board that is a combination post-amplifier,
discriminator, time-to-digital converter (TDC) and also has a trigger
output path to provide track segment information for an online tracking trigger.
Fourteen such boards are housed in
a proprietary 9U, 160 mm depth, VXS form factor/crate.
The whole system consisted of 18 such crates, one for each drift chamber.

To perform its time digitization task, the DCRB utilizes on-board synchronization to
return the signal time relative to an input time signal from  a Trigger Distribution
Crate.
Its design and architecture
allows it to achieve the following performance metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item DCRB Performance Metrics
\begin{itemize}
\item Amplification: variable gain from X10 to X30 eliminates saturation
\item Time Digitization: accuracy better than 1 ns; exceeds DC specifications
\item Whole Crate Time Synchronization: through backplane; eliminates cables
\item Event Buffer Size: 500,000 signals
\item VME Transfer Rate: 200 MB/sec
\item Maximum Trigger Rate: greater than 1 MHz
\item Dead-time: 32 ns
\item Scaler: 1 32 bit scaler per channel
\item Track Segment Finding: employs segment-hit dictionary in 32 ns bins
\item Track Segment Reporting: reports found segments to the next-level Track Finder
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In addition to its primary functions of time digitization of DC signals and online
track-finding, the internal scaler functions allow the DCRB to be used in 
a stand-alone manner to efficiently monitor chamber operation during commissioning
and testing.

\subsection{Grounding Scheme}
We used a ``one-point'' grounding scheme.  The drift chambers themselves were insulated
from the torus magnet through use of an insulating portion of the link
mounting system.  The off-chamber readout boards (DCRB's) were likewise not grounded
to the chambers themselves though the use of non-grounded twisted-pair signals.
The low-voltage power supplies were floating, supplying a plus and minus line 
to the STB's.
The grounding point was at the High Voltage supply crates.  This was accomplished
by the use of two ground wires for every high-voltage 34-wire multi-cable.
