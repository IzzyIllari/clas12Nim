\section{Drift Chamber System Conceptual Design}

When the CLAS detector~\cite{clasnim} was upgraded to become the CLAS12 detector, the
drift chambers were re-designed.  We kept many of the design concepts of the original CLAS
chambers~\cite{dcnim}, but made improvements in a number of areas.

\subsection{Physics Requirements for CLAS12 Forward Tracking}

There are several broad areas of physics research that drive 
the design of the forward tracking system: 
spectroscopic studies of excited baryons, investigations of 
the influence of nuclear matter on propagating quarks, studies of polarized 
and unpolarized quark distributions, and a comprehensive measurement of 
generalized parton distributions (GPDs). 

The cross sections for these processes are small, necessitating high-luminosity 
experiments.  A variety of experiments rely on luminosities of 
10$^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ to achieve the desired statistical accuracy in 
runs of a few months duration.  This is an order of magnitude increase
compared to the previous CLAS detector.  

The new kinematic range available to the CLAS12 experiment is
characterized not only by smaller cross sections, but also by more outgoing 
particles per event, with those particles being emitted at larger momenta
and smaller laboratory angles.  
A final state of a few high-momentum, forward-going particles (the electron as well as one 
or more mesons), combined with a moderate-momentum baryon emitted at large 
angles, is the typical event type that determines the specifications of the 
tracking system. 

To cover as much of the hadronic center-of-mass region as possible, the CLAS12 Forward 
Tracker must provide tracking for charged particles emitted at polar angles 
from 5$^\circ$ to 40$^\circ$.  This is complemented by the angular coverage of
the central tracking system, which covers polar angles from  35$^\circ$ to approximately 125$^\circ$.

In addition to large acceptance, our experimental program requires
small systematic uncertainties.  To measure our electroproduction cross sections
to an accuracy of a few percent, we must know the scattered electron's
momentum to $1\%$ and its angle to 1~mrad.  

We need even better momentum resolution on the scattered
electron (with momentum up to 10~GeV) to be able to identify particles
by missing mass, an important technique in exclusive reaction studies.
We performed tracking simulations assuming perfect knowledge of the drift chamber
location (alignment) and perfect knowledge of the magnetic field, and assuming
that the hit resolution in each of the drift chamber layers was $250~\mu$m.
These calculations are shown in Fig.~\ref{simulated-resolution}, where we
plot the estimated fractional momentum resolution (left axis) vs. momentum
for different incoming angles (right axis) as a function of momentum.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These simulations led to our goal of $dp/p \approx 0.3\%$ 
for electrons emitted at small angles ($7^{\circ}$) and high momentum (10~GeV).
This requires very good position resolution per hit (on the order of 250~$\mu$m),
very good positional alignment of the chambers ($\approx$50~$\mu$m), and very good knowledge
of $\int \!\!Bdl$ on the order of 0.2\%.  These goals drive our calibration efforts; for more
information see Section~\ref{calibration}.

Table~\ref{fwd-dc-physics-specifications} lists the physics goals for the main CLAS12 program
and the resulting drift chamber design specifications that will allow us to achieve these goals.

\subsection{Drift Chamber Conceptual Design}

Because the previous CLAS drift chamber system operated 
successfully for 15~years, we re-used many of the design concepts and 
most of the utility infrastructure, including
parts of the gas mixing and handling system, the high voltage 
and low voltage systems, and many of the high voltage and signal cables. 
Refer to our article on the previous CLAS detector~\cite{clasnim} and our article 
on the previous drift chambers themselves~\cite{dcnim} for details.

We kept the same chamber layout as in CLAS:
the forward-tracking system consists of three regions divided into six
sectors as shown in Fig.~\ref{chambers-and-torus}; located just before, inside, 
and just outside the torus field volume, named Regions~1, 2, 
and 3 (and referred to as R1, R2, and R3), respectively.  
Each chamber has its wires arranged in two superlayers (SLs) of
six layers each, with the wires in the two superlayers strung with 
$\pm$6$^\circ$ stereo angles to each other.  The cell structure is 
hexagonal, that is, each sense wire is surrounded by six field wires.  This 
arrangement offers good resolution with very good pattern recognition properties.  

The major difference compared to the previous design is that the 
chambers are located further downstream from the target and thus the drift
cells cover a smaller solid angle than those in the previous CLAS 
chambers, allowing efficient tracking at higher luminosities because the 
accidental occupancy from particles not associated with the event is smaller.  

\subsection{Design Features}

Table~\ref{fwd-dc-design-parms} lists the main design parameters for each 
region of the CLAS12 drift chambers.  For the purposes of simulating 
track resolutions, we assumed that the position resolution of the individual 
drift cells would be 250~$\mu$m.  The material budget for multiple scattering
consists of about 0.02 radiation lengths before the R1 chambers due to an assumed 5~cm LH$_2$
target, the gas and low-mass mirrors in the Cherenkov counter, and the remainder of air.
The total material in the R1, R2 and R3 chambers (each filled with a 90/10 mixture
of argon/CO$_2$) and the intervening air also amounts to $\sim$0.02 radiation lengths.

\subsubsection{Design Elements in Common with the Previous CLAS Chambers}

The CLAS12 drift chambers share some design characteristics with the previous CLAS chambers:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Wire Layout}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``brick-wall'' wire layout resulting in individual hexagonally shaped
drift cells in a plane perpendicular to the wire direction;
\item sense wire layers are grouped into two ``superlayers'' of 6 layers each;
\item the ``endplates'' on the two sides of the chamber are tilted 
at $\sim$60$^\circ$ with respect to each other.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Chamber Body Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item to maximize the active volume of the chamber, the ``dead areas'', e.g.
the endplates and electronics boards, are kept as thin as possible;
\item because of the possibility of large eddy currents and resultant
force on the endplates in case of the quench of our torus magnet, we again
use non-conducting Stesalit 4411W endplates for our R2 chambers; (``Stesalit'' is 
a trademark of STESALIT AG for a disordered epoxy-fiberglass composite product.  See
Ref.~\cite{dcnim} on the previous CLAS drift chambers for more information.);
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Gas Choice:} 90:10 argon:CO$_2$ mixture.  We operate at a gas gain of 
about $5 \times 10^4$.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{superlayout} is a schematic of the cell layout for a single superlayer.
The wires are arranged in a ``brick wall'' pattern with one layer of guard wires,
two layers of field wires, one layer of sense wires, another two layers of field
wires, and so on, for a total of 2 guard wire layers, 14 field wire layers and
6 sense wire layers.  The result is an hexagonal cell layout with each sense wire
surrounded by 6 field wires.

\subsubsection{Design Improvements Compared to the Previous CLAS Chambers}

To improve the chambers' performance we made some important changes to the design:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Mechanical Design}
\begin{itemize}
\item all chambers have the same, roughly equilateral triangular, shape;
\item the previous CLAS chambers were interconnected to each other (R1) or 
connected directly to the torus (R2).  In the present chambers all of the wire tension
is borne by the endplates and thus they can be independently mounted.
The key to this improvement is the use of  
ultra-stiff endplate assemblies that obtain their stiffness 
by a flanged design;
\item all chambers are independent and self-supporting, allowing easy
maintenance and repair.  The chambers are attached to the torus cryostat using 6 independent
rods arranged in a ``ball-and-socket'' linkage system, enabling the chambers to
be moved out to their maintenance position and back to the operating 
position by turning one precision turn-buckle assembly.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Cell Design and Wire Layout}
\begin{itemize}  
\item For the previous CLAS detector, the $\phi$ resolution times $\sin \theta$ was about two 
times larger than the $\theta$ resolution.  To have more equal resolution in 
the two angles, we doubled our stereo angle from 0 and 6$^\circ$ to 
$\pm$6$^\circ$;
\item all chambers are planar, with the first superlayer (of 6 layers)
tilted at a 6$^\circ$ stereo angle, and the second superlayer at a -6$^\circ$ stereo angle;
\item all wires within one superlayer are parallel to each other, thus
every cell in one superlayer is identical, making it easier to model
and fit the distance-to-time response.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Wire Choice}
\begin{itemize}
\item all chambers are strung with 30-$\mu$m gold-plated tungsten wire,
considerably tougher and easier to handle than our previous choice 
of 20-$\mu$m wire;
\item the choice of the cathode (``field'') wire is 80-$\mu$m
gold-plated copper-beryllium, tougher and with better surface properties than our previous
choice of 140-$\mu$m gold-plated aluminum wire;
\item  Our choice of guard wire is 140-$\mu$m diameter, gold-plated
copper-beryllium.  These wires were strong enough that we pre-tensioned 
the chambers using only the guard wires; a simplification in the process.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{fwd-dc-design-features} lists the advantages and disadvantages
of the various design features.

\subsubsection{Wire Diameter}

One of the most significant design changes was the decision 
to use 30-$\mu$m diameter sense wire rather than the previously used 
20-$\mu$m wire. This should make the chambers more resistant to wire 
breakage.  The larger radius of the sense wires means that higher 
voltages will be required to achieve the same gas gain, see
Section~\ref{determine-operating-parameters} for more details.
Prototypes were built to study possible negative side-effects of the 
higher voltage operation, such as leakage currents on the circuit boards 
and/or higher rates of cathode emission from the field wire surfaces.
No such effects were seen.
We discuss the wire choice in more detail in Section~\ref{construction}.
