\section{Hall~B Beamline Design}
\label{beamlinedesign}

The Hall~B beamline is divided into two segments, the so-called ``2C'' line from the Beam Switch Yard (BSY)
following beam extraction from the CEBAF accelerator to Hall~B, and the ``2H'' line from the upstream end
of the experimental hall to the beam dump in the downstream tunnel. The beamline upstream of CLAS12 is
furnished with a number of quadrupoles, corrector dipoles, and beam diagnostic tools, grouped into sections.
Accelerator operators have exclusive control of these devices and use this instrumentation to tune and deliver
the beam to the CLAS12 target located approximately at the geometrical center of the hall. In addition to the
devices used by accelerator operations, there are several beam position, current, polarization, and halo monitors
that are controlled and monitored by the Hall~B shift personnel. 

For high-energy operation of CLAS12, the 2C beamline as described in Ref.~\cite{HPSBeamline} was modified to
include the M{\o}ller polarimeter located in the upstream tunnel of the hall and an intermediate beam dump just
upstream of the hall. Additionally, the 2H beamline (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hall1}) now includes a cryogenic target and a
tungsten shield downstream of the target inside the CLAS12 torus magnet bore. The M{\o}ller polarimeter is used
to periodically measure the longitudinal beam polarization and is discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{mollerpol}.
The other components are discussed in the following subsections.

\subsection{Intermediate Beam Dump Before CLAS12}
\label{sec-IBD}

In order to prevent radiation damage to the sensitive detectors during the initial beam tune, or when errant beam
may be sent to the hall, or during the beam polarization measurements with the M{\o}ller polarimeter, the beam
has to be terminated upstream of CLAS12. For these operations the Hall~B tagger dipole magnet is used to deflect
the primary beam and secondary scattering products. During low-energy operations, the tagger dipole directs the
beam into the tagger beam dump in the hall floor upstream of the CLAS12 spectrometer. The highest energy beam
that can be directed to this dump is limited to 6.2~GeV by the maximum field of the tagger dipole, 1.76~T
\cite{tagger}. At higher energies, several options for the intermediate beam dump were considered during the
design stage with the optimal solution being to dump the beam inside the bore of the tagger magnet yoke. The
design of the intermediate dump was based on full FLUKA~\cite{fluka} simulations and on thermal finite-element
analysis. The two main parameters that were studied were the radiation levels at the location of the CLAS12
tracking detectors and the temperature rise in the magnet yoke when up to 10~nA of continuous wave (CW) electron
beam is dumped on the yoke.  

The FLUKA simulations were used to determine background radiation levels at the tracking detectors for different
configurations of the dump and compared with radiation levels from various targets and beam currents at the design
luminosity.  It was found that acceptable background radiation levels from the dump occur when the beam is steered
into the yoke at approximately 33~cm from the upstream entrance to the tagger magnet bore, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:yokedump}. This is done by setting the tagger magnetic field to be
$I({\rm A}) = 43.491\times E({\rm GeV}) - 0.076$, where $I$ and $E$ are the tagger power supply current and
the beam energy, respectively.

  brown region indicates the cross section of the tagger yoke.}

The FLUKA simulations were also used to guide the design of the shielding around and just downstream of the
tagger magnet yoke. The shielding includes lead, borated polyethylene, and concrete blocks.
Figure~\ref{fig:raddem} shows the 1-MeV neutron equivalent fluency for the background from the dump and for
various beam/target configurations as a function of the position along the beamline. In the graph, the yoke dump
position is at approximately -900~cm and the CLAS12 target is at $\sim$400~cm. The figure shows that at the
location of the CLAS12 target, the designed shielding configuration (filled black points) results in radiation levels
from the yoke comparable to levels for running on a carbon target at the full design luminosity.

To assess the temperature increase in the yoke, a thermal finite-element analysis was set up using ANSYS
Workbench v18~\cite{ANSYS}. A simplified CAD model of the yoke was imported and modified to include a
cylindrical heat load representing the beam. The heating profile from the deposition of 1~kW of power in a
cylinder of one Moliere radius ($r$=1.7~cm) and 10 radiation lengths (17~cm) of iron was calculated. Conservatively,
adiabatic boundary conditions were applied to the outer surfaces of the yoke. The model was solved as a transient
thermal analysis with 100 time points over 3600 seconds. At the dump location, the temperature was found to
initially increase rapidly and then stabilized to a maximum temperature increase of $\Delta T = 54^\circ$C as the
heat dissipates throughout the yoke volume (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ansys_yoke}). Due to the very large volume and heat
capacity of the yoke, the temperature is not expected to rise much higher even for longer beam application times.

\subsection{Cryogenic Target}
\label{sec-cryotgt}

Hall~B experiments are grouped into running periods according to beam energy and targets. So far two types of
cryogenic targets have been used for experiments; liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$) and liquid deuterium (LD$_2$). The
Hall~B cryotarget system from the 6~GeV era~\cite{CLAS} has been modified for CLAS12 operations. The
current target cell is a 50-mm long Kapton cone with 23.66~mm and 15.08~mm upstream and downstream
diameters, respectively. The entrance and exit windows for the beam are 30-$\mu$m-thick aluminum. The
typical target density is 71~mg/cm$^3$ for LH$_2$ and 169~mg/cm$^3$ for LD$_2$. The cryo-liquids are
sub-cooled to reduce the density variations and prevent boiling and the formation of bubbles.
Figure~\ref{fig:targsch} shows the design rendering of the target cell inside the scattering chamber. The
scattering chamber is made of Rohacell XT110 foam (density $\rho=0.110$ g/cm$^3$) and is $\sim$45 cm long
with a 100~mm outer diameter such that it fits within the CLAS12 Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT)~\cite{svt-nim}
and provides a minimal material thickness for scattered particles from the target to the CLAS12 detectors.  

A beam halo monitor is integrated within the target cell. This device consists of a 40-mm-long glass cylinder with
inner and outer diameters of 10~mm and 12~mm, respectively, mounted directly on the upstream window of the
target cell with its axis parallel to the beamline and with 16 optical fibers attached to the upstream perimeter of
the cylinder. Light generated in the cylinder from interactions of the beam halo or from back-scattered secondaries
is read out with a multi-anode photomultiplier tube (PMT). The device, called the  beam-offset monitor (BOM), is
used to monitor the beam position at the target (see discussion below).  

The scattering chamber extends downstream of the Central Detector. There is a 50-$\mu$m-thick aluminum
window on the downstream end of the scattering chamber that closes the upstream vacuum beamline (from the
accelerator to the CLAS12 target). The downstream vacuum beamline starts after a 60-cm-long air gap after the
scattering chamber and ends at the beam dump.

\label{fig:targsch}

\end{figure}

In addition to the cryogenic targets mentioned above and already used in two experiments (LH$_2$ and LD$_2$),
there will be experiments that will use nuclear targets in the form of thin foils and experiments with polarized
targets. The nuclear target assembly is similar to the cryogenic target cell except that various target foils will be
inside the cell instead of a liquid. The cryotarget supply lines will be used to flow helium gas through the cell to
dissipate heat in the foils from the beam. Two types of polarized targets will be used for CLAS12 experiments
\cite{Keith:2015ete}; dynamically (longitudinally) polarized ammonia (NH$_3$) and deuterated ammonia (ND$_3$),
and a polarized solid HD target in a frozen spin mode.

\subsection{Shielding Downstream of the Target} 

Special care was taken to protect the CLAS12 detectors from beam-induced background radiation. The main sources
of the background are M{\o}ller scattering and small-angle electron scattering along with electromagnetic processes
such as bremsstrahlung and pair production. These interactions produce photons, electrons, and positrons that can
flood the tracking detectors. GEANT4 simulations of CLAS12 have been used to study backgrounds and design
appropriate shielding to reduce the levels of background radiation~\cite{sim-nim}. The shielding design takes
advantage of the 5-T longitudinal magnetic field around the target that is generated by the Central Detector
superconducting solenoid magnet. This strong longitudinal magnetic field causes low-energy particles to spiral
forward and away from the detectors and into the shielding far downstream of the target. The heavy shielding
materials (lead and tungsten) contain the background and either absorb it or guide the flux of particles out of the
downstream end of CLAS12 without interacting in the detectors. 

Experiments in CLAS12 will run with or without the Forward Tagger (FT)~\cite{ft-nim} in use. These two different
detector configurations require two different shielding configurations. Figure~\ref{fig:shield} shows the
configuration when the FT is not used (called FT-OFF). The shielding starts with a tungsten cone with a 5-cm
diameter hole at the center for the beam. When the FT is in use (called FT-ON), the tungsten cone is mounted
directly to the FT central support, which is also made from tungsten. In the latter case, the angular acceptance
of particles scattered from the target starts at $\sim$2$^\circ$. For the FT-OFF configuration, a large diameter
lead cylinder is inserted between the FT central support (after removing the FT tracker) and the tungsten cone,
thus moving the tip closer to the target. In this case the acceptance for forward scattered particles starts at
$\sim$5$^\circ$. The shielding elements also include cylindrical tungsten absorbers inside the torus bore, a
tungsten shield around the FT mounting fixture to the torus, and a lead-tungsten shield downstream of the torus.

  FT-ON configuration and the bottom graph is for FT-OFF. The main source of the background is the target located
  at $(r,z)=(0,0)$. The second largest source is the edge of the tungsten shield that starts from (40~mm,850~mm)
  and extends to (60~mm,1700~mm), followed by the outer edge of the Forward Tagger calorimeter enclosure located
  around $r$=200~mm and $z$=2000~mm. The other large source is the mirror of the High Threshold Cherenkov
  Counter~\cite{htcc-nim} shown as almost vertical band at around $z$=1550~mm.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

One of the main criteria for the shielding design is to maintain an occupancy rate in the drift chambers~\cite{dc-nim}
of less than 4\% since higher occupancies adversely affect the track reconstruction efficiency~\cite{recon-nim}.
The drift chamber occupancies were simulated by accumulating hits in the detector elements over 250-ns time
frames, which roughly corresponds to the readout time window for the set of drift chambers closest to the
beam-target interaction point. The simulated beam was spread out over this time window to match the actual beam
structure and was incident on the 5-cm-long LH$_2$ target such that the design luminosity of
$10^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ was achieved in the simulation. The simulated target included the aluminum entrance
and exit foils and the air gap downstream of the target. The final shielding configuration resulted in occupancies of
less than about 3\% for the FT-ON configuration and less than about 1.5\% for the FT-OFF configuration.
Figure~\ref{fig:origin} shows the origins of background particles hitting the drift chambers for both shielding
configurations. The main source of the background is the target, with other sources being the edges of the
tungsten shield and the detector enclosures (see figure caption for details).
