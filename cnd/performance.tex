\section{Performance}
After the calibration constants are determined, the timing, position, and deposited energy of each hit are reconstructed, and clusters are formed grouping hits according to their position and timings \cite{recon-nim}.

Data taken during the first CLAS12 experiments, on hydrogen and deuterium targets, and with various beam energies (7.5 and 10.6 GeV), were analyzed to verify the performance of the CND. 

The timing performance for the three layers of the CND are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig_performance_deltat_layers}, showing the vertex time difference $v_t$ for selected negative tracks, assumed to be all pions, integrated over all sectors defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq_vtp_definition}
v_t=t_{\rm{CND}}-(t_{\rm{S}}-vz_{corr})-\frac{path}{c \cdot \beta} ,
\end{equation}
where $t_{\rm{CND}}$ is the mean time reconstructed from the L and R paddles, $t_{\rm{S}}$ is the event start time determined by the RF bucket matched with the FTOF vertex time, $vz_{corr}$ accounts for the actual $z$ position of the interaction vertex, $path$ is the path length from the event vertex to the CND and
\begin{equation}\label{eq_beta_definition}
  \beta=\frac{p}{\sqrt{p^2+m^2}},
\end{equation}
with $p$ the momentum measured by the CVT, and $m$ the pion mass. 
The distribution of $v_t$ is centered at 0, and from its width one can deduce the timing resolution of each CND paddle, convoluted with the CVT resolution, using the formula:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_resolution}
\sigma_t=\sqrt{\sigma_{v_t}^2-\sigma_{t_{S}}^2}=0 , \rm{ps}, 
\end{equation}
assuming the resolution on the start time $\sigma_{t_{S}}$ being 20 ps \cite{ftof-nim}.
%This is compatible with the detector specifications (150 ps) and the result of the measurements in cosmic rays during the detector assembly phase \cite{Niccolai:2018qzm} (148 ps).
The timing resolution for the 144 counters, individually, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_performance_vt_sigma_allpaddles}. Its average (indicated by the horizonthal line) is around 185 ps, which is more than the average intrinsic timing resolution measured with cosmic rays (148 ps \cite{Niccolai:2018qzm}). This discrepancy is due to multiple factors, such as the current, not fully optimized, quality of the calibrations and reconstruction, as well as the indetermination on the pathlength and on the other non-CND terms of Eq.~\ref{eq_vtp_definition}.

The position reconstruction performances of the CND can be checked in Fig.~\ref{fig_performance_deltaz}, which displays the difference between the $z$ coordinate computed by the CND and by the CVT, for negative tracks, and for the three layers of the CND, integrated over all paddles. Its Gaussian width is around 3 cm, corresponding roughly to $4^{\circ}$ in polar-angle resolution. This corresponds to the convolution of the angular resolutions of CND and CVT.

Figure~\ref{fig_performance_edep} shows the energy deposited divided by path length, for selected MIPs. It peaks at around the expected value of 1.956 MeV/cm.

\subsection{Neutron detection efficiency}
The exclusive reaction $e p \rightarrow e n \pi^+$ was analyzed to evaluate the neutron detection efficiency of the CND. The data used were taken with a 7.5-GeV electron beam inpinging on a liquid-hydrogen target. Events with an electron and a $\pi^+$ in the CLAS12 Forward Detector were selected. The missing mass of the $e \pi^+ X$ system is plotted versus $\beta_X$ in Fig.~\ref{fig_performance_selection}. The missing particle is required to be in the CLAS12 Central Detector (CD) ($\theta>40^\circ$). The effect of this selection is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_performance_selection}. We apply an additional cut on $\beta$ of the missing neutron ($0.2<\beta_X<0.8$). From this set of $e p \rightarrow e (n) \pi^+$ events, events with a neutron identified by the CND (CND cluster with $E_{dep}>2.5$ MeV, no associated tracks, $\beta<0.8$) were selected. If multiple neutron candidates were detected by the CND, the neutron with the smallest momentum separation from the missing neutron was kept. A cut on $\beta>0.2$ was applied to remove out-of-time hits that could be mistaken as low $\beta$ neutrons. Finally, the detected neutron and the missing neutron azimuthal angle difference is constrained to be less than $20^\circ$.

The efficiency was measured in bins of missing neutron polar angle and as a function of missing momentum. For each bin in polar angle and momentum, the efficiency is defined as the ratio of events with a detected neutron to the number of missing neutron events. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig_performance_efficiency}. The detection efficiency extracted from this method is consistent with simulation predictions and with the design specifications of the CND.
