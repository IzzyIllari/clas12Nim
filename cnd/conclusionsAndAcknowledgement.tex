\section{Conclusion}
This article presented the requirements, the design, the calibration and reconstruction procedures, and the performance of the Central Neutron Detector for CLAS12. It consists of a barrel of three layers of scintillators coupled at their front ends with u-turn light guides and read out at their back sides by ordinary PMTs connected to the bars via 1-m-long bent light guides and placed in the low-field region of the CND. 
The performance measured with real data, which agree with the results of our GEANT4-based simulations, show that the efficiencies obtainable with this detector and its photon-rejection capabilities allow to collect good statistics on the beam-spin asymmetry for the neutron-DVCS reaction over a wide phase space, using the allocated beam time for CLAS12 with deuterium target \cite{Jlab12_CLAS_n}. This detector will also be used in other $n$-DVCS experiments \cite{Jlab12_CLAS_n_pol}, and whenever the detection of the recoil neutron may be required ($N^*$ program, for instance, or all the deeply-virtual meson production reactions on the neutron).
