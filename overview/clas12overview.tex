\section{The CLAS12 Detector}
\label{clas12}
The CLAS12 design is based on a combination of a toroidal magnetic field at polar angles up to 35$^\circ$ and a strong
solenoidal field at central angles in the approximate range $125^\circ \le \Theta \le 35^\circ$. The primary requirement
driving this choice were the ability to measure charged
particles at high momentum with good resolution at forward angles, while operating the detector systems at high luminosity.
This requires effective shielding of the detector system from low energy electrons produced in the target material due to M\"oller
scattering $e^- + e^- \to e^- + e^-$ of the high-energy beam electrons on atomic electrons. The large majority of those
electrons are prevented from reaching
sensitive detectors as they curl up in the strong longitudinal magnetic solenoid field, and then guided into a shielding pipe
made from bulk tungsten material where they dump their energy.  A 3-dimensional view of the CLAS12 detector system is
presented in Figure~\ref{clas12}.

The electron
beam enters from the left and enters the production target located in the center of the solenoid magnet at a magnetic field of
5 Tesla. Scattered electrons and forward going particles are detected in the forward detector (FD) consisting of a high-threshold
Cherenkov counter (HTCC) with full coverage in polar angle $5^\circ \le \theta \le 35^\circ$ and $\Delta \phi = 2\pi$ coverage in azimuth.
Particles then enter the Forward Detector (FD) with momentum analysis of charged particles in the Torus magnet, particle
identification in a fast time-of-flight system and Cherenkov detectors, energy analysis in electromagnetic calorimeters.
Particle generated in the target at polar angles greater than $35^\circ$ are detected in the Central Detector (CD) with its own
particle identification and tracking detectors. Particles scattered at polar angles $2.5^\circ \le \theta \le 4.5^\circ $ are detected
in the calorimeter and tracker of the forward tagger (FT) .  }
