The slow controls system provides the necesssary tools for controlling and monitoring all components of the CLAS spectrometer and beamline systems.  User interfaces are unified across diverse types of hardware and detectors, streamlining procedures for novice and expert operators.  Infrastucture tools and central JLab computing support are leveraged for resiliency and minimizing maintainence overhead.
