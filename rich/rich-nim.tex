A Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector has been installed in the CLAS12 spectrometer at the
Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) to provide kaon identification in the momentum range between 3 and 8 GeV/c. The detector adopts a hybrid optics solution with aerogel radiator, light planar and spherical mirrors and highly-segmented photon detectors. We report here on the design, construction and initial performance of the RICH during the commissioning of the detector and the first physics data taking.

\section{Overview}
%-----------------------------------------------

Particle identification (PID) of hadrons in the Forward Detector of CLAS12 baseline is obtained by combining the information of High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC), Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC) and Time-of-Flight (FTOF). However, no sufficient separation of kaons from pions and protons can be achieved by using only these detectors in the momentum range relevant for the Semi-Inclusive Deeep Inelastc Scattering (SIDIS) approved physics program, i.e. between 3 and 8 GeV/c. Therefore, improved particle identification in this momentum range is achieved by replacing two sectors of the existing LTCC with a Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The first module of the RICH detector was completed before the start of the physics run, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:RICHPic}, while the installation of the second module in the opposite sector is foreseen for the beginning of the CLAS12 operation with polarized targets. This article reports on the design, construction and initial performance of the first RICH module. The second module will be identical to the first one.\\
The idea of a RICH detector is based on the fact that when a fast particle crosses a radiator with a velocity $\beta$ larger than the velocity of the light in that medium, it emits Cherenkov photons. The light is emitted in a cone with opening angle $\theta_C$ given by $\cos(\theta_C)=1/\beta n(\lambda)$, where $n(\lambda)$ is the refractive index of the radiator, which may depend on the wavelength $\lambda$. After a gap region where the cone opens up, the photons are detected and the ring can be reconstructed. A precision measurement of the Cherenkov angle provides the velocity of the particle and, together with information from the tracking system, it allows its identification. Thus, the capability of identify particles with a known momentum and different velocity is governed by the Cherenkov angle resolution, and it can be effectively parameterized by the separation in units of resolution $n_{\sigma}$ between the angle distributions for the various particles.

\section{Detector requirements}
%-----------------------------------------------

The CLAS12 spectrometer in Hall B is designed to operate with highly polarized beam and nucleon targets at a luminosity of $10^{35}$~$\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Under these conditions the production rate of protons, kaons and pions studied using SIDIS Monte Carlo event-lists is such that, in most of the kinematic plane, the kaon rate is about one order of magnitude lower than the rate of pions and protons. Thus, a successfully kaon identification requires a rejection factor from pions around 1:500, i.e. a contamination in the kaon sample of few percent. This corresponds to 4$\sigma$ separation.
In the momentum range between 3 and 8 GeV/c, neither gas nor liquid radiators provide sufficient angular separation to achieve the required pion rejection factor (see Fig. \ref{Fig:Radiators}) and the only viable solution is silica aerogel, an amorphous solid
network of $\rm SiO_2$ nanocrystals with a very low macroscopic density and a refractive index in between gases and liquids.
To detect the Cherenkov light emitted in the visible wavelength range, Hamamatsu Multi-Anode PhotoMultipliers Tubes (MaPMTs) were chosen for their high quantum efficiency in the visible and near UV region, their fast response and the required spatial resolution. Since the RICH detector must fit into the original CLAS12 carriage there were several constraints imposed upon its design. Each sectors required a projective geometry, limited gap depth of 1.2 m and $\sim 4.5$~$\rm m^2$ entrance windows.
Simulation studies favoured a hybrid imaging Cherenkov detector design incorporating aerogel radiators, visible light photon detectors, and a focusing mirror system. The focusing mirror system is used to reduce the detection area instrumented by photon detectors to $\sim 1$~$\rm m^2$ per sector, minimising costs and influence on the Time-of-Flight and electromagnetic calorimeters systems.
Depending upon the incident particle track angle, Cherenkov light is either imaged directly or after one or more reflections and passes through the aerogel. Fig. \ref{Fig:RICHsketch} shows a schematic view of two examples of direct imaging and imaging after multiples reflections.

\section{Detector design}
%-----------------------------------------------

The RICH detector replaces two sectors of the existing gas Cherenkov detector (LTCC) which is located at 5 m distance from the interaction point. The first RICH module was designed while the CLAS12 spectrometer was already under construction and,  as a consequence, it had to cover the same large area to match the trapezoidal shape of the LTCC sector.
This resulted in several challenging requirements for the mechanical structure.
The guiding principles were to minimize the material budget inside the acceptance and to limit the impact on the downstream detectors, ensuring at the same time the rigidity of the structure imposed by the optical requirements.
Therefore, light materials, in particular carbon fiber, were largely utilized for all the elements inside the CLAS12 acceptance.
For all the parts with large dimensions, the sandwich technique, in which two thin solid skins are glued together on a thick honeycomb core, was also used.
This technique indeed combines high stiffness with substantial weight reduction, resulting in a total weight of the detector of about 900 kg, $\sim$ 30\% lower than the LTCC.

A sketch of the detector is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:RICHexplo}.
It is composed of a trapezoidal box (larger base of 4.2 m, smaller base of 0.3 m, height of 3.7 m and depth of 1.2 m) in which all the active elements are installed: the wall of aerogel tiles, the mirrors, the photomultiplier tubes, and the electronics.
The main structural elements of the box are: the two lateral panels made of aluminum sandwich, the top panel made of carbon fiber sandwich, and the two upper angular elements and the bottom element made of aluminum.
Each of the lateral panels supports two planar mirrors, while another planar mirror is installed on the bottom of the box.
The box is closed on the front face (with respect to the beam direction) by two panels made of a sandwich of two 1 mm thick carbon fiber skins glued on a Nomex honeycomb core.
Two planar mirrors with a wall of 2 cm thick aerogel tiles are installed on the lower panel while a wall made of two layers of 3 cm thick aerogel tiles is installed on the upper one. Therefore, the profile of the panels was specifically designed not only to ensure the best light and gas tightness, but also to include stiffening ribs for the installation of the mirrors and the aerogel.
The same sandwich structure was used for the electronic panel, located on the bottom part of the backward face of the box.
It is composed of a main panel where all the front-end electronics and the PMTs are installed, and a thin cover. The panel and the cover are screwed together and on the mechanical structure, making a very rigid system.
Finally, a very light exit panel made of a thin tedlar sheet glued on a aluminum frame not supporting any active element, closes the backward face of the trapezoidal box. 

The total material budget of the detector is largely dominated by the electronic panel, which contributes to approximately 0.3 $X_0$ in the region from the beam line up to about 17$^\circ$.
A sizeable contribution comes also from the aerogel (with a maximum contribution of 0.05 $X_0$ in the polar angles from 17$^\circ$ to 26$^\circ$), while other active components like the spherical and planar mirrors contributes only to approximately 0.01 $X_0$ each.
The total material budget of the passive elements is estimated to be, on average, below 0.05 $X_0$.\\
The mechanical structures and all the active elements (mirrors, aerogel, electronics, MaPMTs) define the RICH detector.
The RICH is attached to the CLAS12 forward carriage by means of steel connections, attached to the angular and bottom elements.\\
Detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) studies were performed in order to optimize the design of the detector with respect to the maximum deformation allowed by the required accuracy of the optical systems.
These studies included optimization of the ratio between skin and honeycomb thicknesses of the sandwich, and of the total thickness and profile of various stiffening and connection elements.
Simulations of the load conditions during the assembly and installation of the detector and in the RICH final position in CLAS12 were also performed together with a seismic analysis \footnote{According the USA regulation, seismic analysis are performed by increasing by 10\% the expected weight load.}.
These simulations demonstrated that all the stresses produced on the detector elements during the installation are well inside the elastic regime, and that the total deformations expected when the RICH is installed in CLAS12 never exceed few mm.

\section{The RICH components}
%-----------------------------------------------

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Mirror System}
%-----------------------------------------------

The mirror system, composed of planar and spherical mirrors, was designed to minimize the photon loss and to direct as much as possible the Cherenkov radiation toward the photodetectors.
Simulations were performed to optimize the segmentation, the position and the radius of curvature of these mirrors, and to define the specifications of the optical performance.
A drawing of the system is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:RICHmirrors}.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{RICHmirrors.pdf}
\caption{Drawing of the CLAS12 RICH mirror system.}
\label{Fig:RICHmirrors}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Spherical Mirrors}
%-----------------------------------------------


The spherical mirror system, installed inside the box in front of the exit panel, has a total surface of about 3.6 m$^2$, a radius of curvature $R= 2.7$ m and is segmented in 10 sub-mirrors.
They were produced by the {\it Composite Mirror Applications} company~\cite{REF:CMA}, and are made of two layers of carbon fiber glued on a honeycomb core of small carbon fiber cylinders.
The areal weight of these mirrors is $\approx 5$ kg/m$^2$, with an improvement of about 30\% with respect to the mirrors produced by the same company for the LHCb experiment \cite{REF:LHCbMirrors}.
Each mirror is positioned on a light carbon frame by means of three special joints equipped with a spring and a precision screw that allowed their relative alignment.
Then, the frame is attached to the mechanical structure by means of three similar joints that allow the alignment of the full mirror system with respect to the other active elements of the detector.

The accuracy of the spherical surface of the sub-mirrors was quantified by means of the so-called spot size measurement, in which each mirror was illuminated with a point-like light source and the size of the reflected spot was measured by a XIMEA camera with a 1 cm wide CMOS sensor.
The size of the spot is quantified by the $D_0$, which is defined as the minimum diameter containing 90\% of the total reflected light and is related to the angular resolution on the reflected photons by the relation
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\theta} = \frac{D_0}{8 R}
\end{equation}
The smallest is the $D_0$, the closer to a perfect sphere is the mirror surface.
The measurements also allow to extract the radius of curvature, which corresponds to the distance between the camera and the mirror where the spot size is minimal.
The results of a typical measurement of one sub-mirror is shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:SpotCMA}, where the $D_0$ as a function of the distance, and the shape of the spot at the beginning of the distance scan and at the minimum, are showed.
All the sub-mirrors exhibit a $D_0$ smaller than 1.5 mm, which means $\sigma_{\theta}$ significantly below 1 mrad, and a variation in the measured radii below 0.5\%. All these numbers are well within the specifications.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{SpotCMA.pdf}
\caption{$D_0$ as function of the distance between the mirror and the camera for one of the spherical sub-mirrors. The two inserts show the shape of the reflected spot at the beginning of the distance scan and at the minimum.}
\label{Fig:SpotCMA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The sub-mirrors were coated with a reflecting layer by the  {\it Evaporated Coatings Inc}~\cite{REF:ECI}.
The quality of this coating was verified by measuring the reflectivity on several surface spots in the wavelength range from 300 to 650 nm.
For all the sub-mirrors, we obtained on average a reflectivity between 88\% and 90\%, relatively flat in the whole range.

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Planar Mirrors}
%-----------------------------------------------

The planar mirror system is completed by 7 mirrors: two installed on each of the lateral panels, two on the frontal panel and one on the bottom, for a total surface of about 6.5 m$^2$.
These mirrors were produced by the {\it Media Lario} company~\cite{REF:MediaLario} and are made by two thin layers of glass glued on a aluminum honeycomb core.
This is a standard technique widely used in telescopes for astrophysics studies but used for the first time in nuclear physics experiments, and allows to produce mirrors as light as the carbon fiber ones but at much lower costs.
Being in the acceptance of the detector, the frontal mirrors use very thin (0.7 mm) glass layers, allowing a reduction of the material budget down to about 0.01 $X_0$, while for the lateral and the bottom mirrors thicker (1.6 mm) glass layers were used.

The planarity of the mirror was measured with a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).
Typically, the measured accuracy of the surface was few microns RMS.
To better quantify the quality of the surface, the local slope profile was reconstructed from the spatial profile, as shown for one of the lateral mirrors in Fig. \ref{Fig:SlopeML}  where we see only few spots with non-zero slope over a largely flat surface.
All the mirrors satisfy the requirement that only few percent of the total surface should exceed a local slope of 0.3 mrad.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{SlopeML.pdf}
\caption{Profile of the local slope (indicated by the color scale in mrad) of the surface of one of the lateral planar mirror measured with a CMM.}
\label{Fig:SlopeML}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Again, the characterization of the planar mirrors was completed by measuring the reflectivity in few random spots of the surface in the wavelength range frm 300 to 650 nm.
The measurements showed a maximum reflectivity of approximately 95 \% at 400 nm and a reflectivity higher than 90 \% in the whole range.

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Aerogel Radiator}
%-----------------------------------------------

The aerogel radiator was produced by the {\it Budker and Boreskov Institute of Nuclear Physics} (Russia), which was able to fabricate tiles of different shape and thickness, a critical requirement of the complex CLAS12 geometry.
A total of 102 tiles with nominal refractive index 1.05, cut with squared $200 \times 200$ $\rm mm^2$ as well as pentagonal, trapezoidal and triangular shape, was assembled in two sections.
The first section, covering the region between the beam pipe and the polar angle of 17.5$^o$, was made of one layer of 2 cm thick tiles.
The second section, covering the polar angles between 17.5$^o$ and 26$^o$, was made of two layers of 3 cm thick tiles, the thickest aerogel tiles ever used in Cherenkov radiation application.

Each tile was tested to determine the geometric and optical parameters~\cite{RICH:RICH2016mc}.
The measured geometric parameters are the side length and thickness and the planarity of the tile surface.
The measured optical parameters include the refractive index at the reference wavelength of 400 nm, and the light transmission as a function of the wavelength. The transparency parameter $A_0$, the clarity parameter $C$ and the scattering length $L_{scatt}$ at 400 nm are then extracted from the measured optical parameters using the Hunt parameterization~\cite{Hunt}.
Distributions of the measured values of the refractive index, $A_0$ (in percent) and $L_{scatt}$ for the squared 2 cm tiles are shown in Fig.\ref{Fig:Aerogel_2cm}.
The average values obtained over all the tiles are $L_{scatt} = 50.5$ mm, $A_0 = 0.975$ and $C = 0.00512$ $\rm \mu m^4 / cm$.
From these measurements, the expected photon yield for $\beta=1$ particles is estimated to be about 19 p.e. in the 2 cm sector and about 25 in the 6 cm (3cm + 3cm) sector.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Photon Detector}
%-----------------------------------------------
Due to the imaging aspect of the RICH, there are several requirements that the photon detector has to fulfill: it has to efficiently detect single photon-electron (SPE) level signal, must be sensitive in the visible light wavelengths (due to the aerogel radiator material), must have the spatial resolution required to achieve the design angular resolution, it has to provides an active area with minimal deadspace. 
In addition, it has to be insensitive to the low torus fringe field where the RICH readout is located, which is estimated to be 3.5 Gauss maximum, see Fig. \ref{fig:MagFringe}.
The Hamamatsu flat-panel H8500 Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tube (\MaPMT)~\cite{Ref:H8500} with an 8x8 array of $6 \times 6$ mm$^2$ pixels over a compact active area of 5x5 $\rm cm^2$ and with high packing fractions (89\%), was initially selected as the good candidate.
%Since at the RICH detector position, the CLAS12 torus fringe field is low enough (see Fig.~\ref{fig:MagFringe} ) this allowed us a flexible choice of the photosensor. The Hamamatsu flat-panel H8500 Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tube (\MaPMT)~\cite{Ref:H8500} with an 8x8 array of 5.80 mmx 5.80 mm pixels over a compact active area of 5x5 $\rm cm^2$ area and with high packing fractions (89\%), was selected as a good candidate.
%The goal of the CLAS12 RICH is to achieve a single photon-electron (SPE) Cherenkov angle resolution of 4.5 mrad.
%At the RICH detector position, the CLAS12 torus fringe field is low enough (see Fig.~\ref{fig:MagFringe}) to allow a flexible choice of the photosensor technology.
%Early simulations~\cite{clas12:rich} led to a photosensor spatial resolution below 1~cm to fulfill the design value of 2~mrad angular resolution
%in the direct light configuration.
%The flat panel Hamamatsu H8500 Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tube (\MaPMT)~\cite{Ref:H8500} was selected to achieve the design angular resolution, thanks to the enhanced sensitivity tothe visible and near-UV light in conjunction with a matching geometrical layout of 64 pixels covering a 5x5 $\rm cm^2$ area with an excellent packing factor of 89\%.
Despite not advertised as the optimal choice in the SPE regime, such \MaPMT showed adequate performance in several laboratory tests~\cite{MaPMT:test} and at beam tests~\cite{RICH:CERN}.
%when used in conjunction with an adapted readout electronics.
Just after the RICH construction startup, the novel Hamamatsu
H12700 became available, with the same layout of the H8500 but an optimized dynode structure for single photon detection~\cite{Ref:H12700}.

Of the 391 MaPMTs CLAS12 RICH employs, 80 of which are of the H8500 type and the rest are of the H12700. This results in a total of 25024 individual pixels, covering the $\sim$ 1 $\rm m^2$ trapezoidal active area of the first RICH module.
% and it is the first large-area detector to employ this new multi-anode photo-multipliers. 
The production specifications included requirements on the minimum gain of $1\cdot10^6$ and a maximum total dark current  of 5 nA. Both were fully achieved.
Fig.~\ref{fig:MaPMTGain} shows the distribution of the pixel gains, that has an average value of $2.7\cdot 10^6$, corresponding to about 400 fC generated charge per SPE.

\subsection{The Readout Electronics}
%-----------------------------------------------

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.00\columnwidth]{TileAssembly.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The CLAS12 RICH readout unit design (see text for details).}
\label{fig:EleTile}
\end{figure}

The RICH front-end electronics is designed to ensure 100\% efficiency at 1/3 of the average photo-electron signal level, 1 to 4 gain spread compensation, time resolution of the order of 1 ns to distinguish direct from reflected photon hits, and a trigger rate up to 20 kHz with 8 $\rm \mu s$ trigger latency.

The front-end electronics is organized in compact units (tiles, see Fig.~\ref{fig:EleTile}) mechanically designed to fit the MaPMT dimensions, each serving two or three MaPMTs, thus allowing the tessellation of large surfaces with minimum dead space and material budget. Each readout unit comprises three boards with complementary functions.

A feed-through {\it adapter board} provides the electrical connectivity of the sensors with the external readout system while preserving the adequate light and gas tightness of the inner detector volume when mounted on the RICH carbon fiber supporting panel. It also distributes the sensor bias voltage (with -1000~Volts as nominal value).

The {\it signal processing board} is based on the MAROC3 chip~\cite{MAROC3:chip}, a 64-channel microcircuit dedicated to MaPMT pulse processing. Each channel comprises a low impedance adjustable gain preamplifier followed by two highly configurable shaping sections with independent processing. The first section embeds a slow shaper and a sample and hold structure to allow linear charge measurements up to 5 pC. Requiring short trigger delays and multiplexed access, this section can be used as a RICH calibration tool. The second section features a fast shaper and an adjustable threshold discriminator to produce, for each input signal, a start and stop logic pulse. A constant-threshold binary readout requires a good stability of the baseline (pedestal) and definition of the working point (gain and threshold). During the board production, quality assurance tests confirmed the excellent sensitivity of the logical readout, able to discriminate signals down to a few percent of a single photon-electron discharge, as will be extensively discussed in Sect. \ref{sec:Commissioning}.

The third stage of the readout is made of the FPGA boards, hosting a Xilinx7 FPGA chip, in charge to configure and read the front end MAROC3, to distribute the trigger and to interface with the data acquisition systems via optical link. The FPGA provides a TDC functionality with a 1 ns time stamp for both start and stop times. The start time is used for timing purposes, while the difference between the stop and start times, the so-called Time-Over-Threshold (ToT), provides a non-linear estimate of the amplitude of the input signal and is used for the time walk correction, see Sec.~\ref{sec:TimeCalib}. Finally, the FPGAs also embeds a self-trigger scaler readout which is used as a calibration and monitor tool.

%-----------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{MaPMTs Characterization}
%-----------------------------------------------
\label{sec:FEtests}

The characterization of hundreds MaPMTs is a  challenging problem. 
In order to test them efficiently within a reasonable timeframe a fully automated test stand was build to evaluate 6 MaPMTs at once. 
The test stand consists of a 470 nm diode laser system, 2 long travel motorized stands to drive laser fiber in two dimensional space for individual pixel illumination, and a motorized neutral density filter system.
The laser light is directed through the fiber and attenuated to the single photon level using neutral density filters to mimic the conditions of the RICH detector.
The motors are remotely controlled to move the focused laser beam across the entire surface of the MaPMT entrance window and illuminate one by one the 64 pixels individually (Fig.~\ref{fig:beamopt1}).
Alternatively, one can illuminate the whole surface of the MaPMT photocathode at once using an Engineered Diffuser to produce square pattern with non-Gaussian intensity distribution (Fig.~\ref{fig:beamopt2}).  
This configuration was used for the massive characterization of the RICH MaPMTs, bringing routine workload to minimum.
The evaluation of 6 MaPMTs (corresponding to 384 individual channels) at 4 different high voltages and 6 different light intensities was completed in 6 hours with less than 15 minutes of human intervention.

\end{figure}

The characteristics of the SPE spectrum were studied using the charge measurement functionality of the slow shaper of the MAROC3 chip.
A new computational model ~\cite{Pavel} for the description of the photomultiplier response functions of both the H8500 and H12700 MaPMTs was developed. Important features of the model include the ability to approximate the true single-photoelectron spectra (SPE) from different photomultiplier tubes with a variety of parametrized spectral shapes.
%, reflecting the variability in the design and in the individual parameters of the detectors. The new techniques were developed in the process of building the model, such as the method of decomposition of the spectra into a series of elementary Poisson probability density functions, and the use of convolution algebra to build the multi-photoelectron amplitude distributions describing measured spectra. 
The predictive power of the model was tested by demonstrating that the SPE spectral parameters, obtained in the measurements, may describe well the amplitude distributions of the same photodetector measured at different levels of irradiation and applied high voltage. Thus, the model allowed us to extract the characteristic parameters of the devices independently of the test measurement conditions.


The SPE spectrum is extracted by fitting with the model function the signal amplitude distribution measured by the MaPMT as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:SPEH8500} for the H8500 MaPMT and in Fig.~\ref{fig:SPEH12700} for the H12700. The x-axis is calibrated in terms of charge measured by the MAROC3 chip.
%The probability of an initial photon to knock out $m$ photoelectrons is distributed according to the Poissonian $P(m;\mu)=\frac{\mu^me^{-\mu}}{m!}$.
%To approximate the performance of the first amplification cascade of the MaPMT the probability function $T(n,m;\bf{t})$ was introduced in the model as trinomial sum of three Poissoanians with different average secondary multiplicities and the corresponding three relative probabilities for every photoelectron to generate secondary electrons, here $m$ is the number of the electrons knocked out from the first dynode and $n$ is the number of electrons emitted out of the second dynode.

The data showed that the H12700 has, on average, a 10\% better efficiency than the H8500, likely due to the improved photocathode performance and collection efficiency. An example of the results for one MaPMT is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PavelPassport}. The $scale$ parameter (left plot), characterizing the amplification (dynode) system, is virtually independent on the light radiation level while strongly dependent on the high voltage supply, the exact behavior one would expect from the characteristic of internal dynode system of MaPMT. On the contrary, the parameter $\nu$ (center plot) related to the first dynode performance, is relatively independent from the bias voltage. The right plot shows the quantum efficiency parameter $\mu$ measured with different optical filters. Here we see that all the channels respond in the same way as the light intensity increases.

\end{figure}

The results of the characterization have been stored in the CLAS database and are available for use in the Monte Carlo simulations. The extracted gain values have been used to perform the equalization of all the 25024 readout channels.

The plots show the dependence %on two parameters while keeping fixed the third: bias voltage (left) or threshold (right).

%\end{figure}

The dark noise SPE spectra allow to study the efficiency dependence on the working parameters, i.e. MaPMT bias voltage, MAROC pre-amplification gain and discriminator threshold \footnote{The programmeded threshold levels are expressed as Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) units, 1 DAC unit corresponds to about 1 mV} using the binary readout line. 
Data indicated that the efficiency reaches a plateau over a wide range of working parameter values~\cite{Ref:RICHElectro}. %(see Fig.~\ref{Fig:EfScan}). 
The plateau corresponds to the region where all the MaPMT discharges  are digitized and the efficiency ultimately depends on the quality of the photocathode. The plateau is a consequence of the saturated mode employed in the MAROC binary readout and allows a flexible definition of the working point, a crucial feature when dealing with a large number of channels in the challenging single-photon regime.

\subsection{Services}
%-----------------------------------------------

The CLAS12 RICH requires various services, namely power, cooling and gas purge whose number of lines has to be minimized and installed outside of the CLAS12 acceptance.\\
A continuous nitrogen flow, supplied by the Hall-B distribution system, is provided in order to keep the relative humidity inside the RICH vessel at few percent level. The flow is set to about 60 l/m to ensure a complete inner volume exchange in few hours. 
%The nitrogen is supplied by the Hall-B distribution system based on a large dewar filled of liquid nitrogen. 
A backup system has been realized by a stack of nitrogen bottles to allow to safely run up to 3 days in case of failure of the primary distribution system.\\
The electronic power is controlled by a CAEN SY4527 power unit with five 8 channel A2518 LV boards and five 32 channel A1536 HV boards. Each LV channel powers 4 FPGA boards, while one HV channel drives one MaPMT. The electronic readout is connected to the back-end by three MTP trunks of 2.5 Gbps optical fibers. One trunk groups several multi-core fibers, each of them connecting one of the eight ports in the VME/SSP~\cite{XXX} back-end module to four FPGA boards.\\
The readout electronics dissipates about 3.5 W per unit, mainly due to the FPGA chip and the optical tranceiver, as shown by the thermocamera image in Fig.~\ref{Fig:EleTile}. The total heat load, at the level of 500 W, is removed by a forced air flow. Since the electronic panel is not fully sealed due to the numerous holes for the passing through readout and HV connectors, there is a diffusive exchange in the RICH vessel between the nitrogen gas used to keep the aerogel dry and the air in the electronic panel. As a consequence, a dry and clean air is required to cool down the electronics. This is achieved with an Altas Copco multi-core oil free rotary scroll air compressor. The compressor fills a tank at 8 atm pressure, from where the cooling air is filtered and circulated towards two distributors located at the sides of the electronic panel and outside the acceptance. These are made of stainless steel tubes with several nozzles to direct the cooling air supersonic flow along the board surface. The exhaust is made of six corrugated tubes that run in the back of the RICH module behind the spherical mirror.

\section{Assembly and installation of the detector}
%-----------------------------------------------
The assembly of the RICH detector was performed in a clean room and each element was installed after the completion of the relative characterization tests.
The trapezoidal RICH vessel was attached to a large aluminum structure with a pivot to rotate the detector from the vertical to the horizontal position, as required by the various assembling phases.

%This assembly phase included also a detailed survey of the position and alignment
%of each inner element, in particular the mirrors, with respect to the mechanical structure of the detector.
The ten spherical sub-mirrors were mounted on a common frame attached to the RICH mechanical structure. 
To minimize the material budget, the frame is composed by a net of 1.5 mm thick carbon-fiber U-profiles. Each element (frame and sub-mirrors) has three mounting points designed to allow a precise alignment. The relative alignment of the sub-mirrors was performed with the same setup used to determine their surface accuracy. The full spherical mirror was illuminated by a point-like source and the position of each sub-mirror was adjusted until the ten spot images converged into the nominal center of curvature. In Fig.~\ref{fig:MirSpots}, the reflected images before the alignment (when each sub-mirror produces a spot at a different location) and after the alignment (when all the spots overlap within a few mm) are shown. The quality of the result is also visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:MirAlign}, where the spherical mirror system before (left) and after (right) the alignment is shown.

\caption{The spherical mirror before (left) and after (right) alignment. As a result of the alignment, the image appears continuous along the whole mirror surface.}
\label{fig:MirAlign}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The lateral and bottom planar mirrors were mounted inside the RICH trapezoidal vessel. The two frontal mirrors were mounted on the lower-frontal closing panel made of carbon-fiber. The relative position of the mirrors was aligned with respect to the RICH vessel at the level of about 0.5 mrad by using a faro-arm. The mirror system fully installed as seen from the entrance panel is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mirrors}.

\label{fig:mirrors}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The RICH photon detectors and readout electronics were installed on the electronic panel using an independent aluminum support to get an easy access and to allow rotations during the functionality tests. The photomultipliers with higher gain were placed closer to the beam pipe, were the better detection performance is required. The fully equipped electronic panel is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:MaPMTs} from the MaPMTs side and in Fig.~\ref{fig:electronics} from the readout electronics side.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

After the electronics panel assembling was completed, particular care was devoted to minimize and stabilize the pedestal width values.
The measured pedestal RMS was initially at the level of few DAC units, with relatively large variations not only from MaPMT to MaPMT but also among the channels of a single MaPMT, as it is shown in the top plot of Fig.\ref{fig:GroundG}. As the readout uses a single threshold value per chip (or MaPMT), the channel by channel variation may effect the single channel efficiency in a way that  would be complicated to correct for. Therefore, a grounding grid was realized by connecting with a copper wire all the boards with the detector chassis. In ths way, all the components of the readout system, powered by floating 5V low-voltage lines, was properly referred to the same ground. This reduced the typical pedestal RMS down to about 1 DAC unit, a level comparable to the test bench results, as shown in the bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:GroundG}.

\end{figure}

Several other tests were performed at various stages of the electronics assembling, using cosmic rays.
%detected by a tracking system installed on a dedicated trigger station inside a large dark box. 
%The set up used was composed of a large dark box and two plastic scintillators positioned on the top and bottom to define the cosmic ray trajectory. The Cherenkov light generated by an aerogel tile placed inside the box was detected by the electronic panel also placed Inside the box.
In the absence of a precise measure of the cosmic particle momentum it was not possible to perform any study of the Cherenkov angle resolution.
Nevertheless, cosmic runs allowed to validate the translation tables relating the electronic channels to the pixel positions, to develop the ring reconstruction software, to verify the stability of the system, and to test the performance of the services as power supplies, cooling, readout, slow-control and interlocks. After all the planned tests were completed, the complete readout system was eventually transferred into the mechanical structure.

%and the closing panels temporarily mounted. The backward side of the RICH was then completed by installing the upper exit panel.
The aerogel was the last element installed, being the most sensitive to the external conditions. For this reason, before its assembling, a test to verify the gas-tightness of the RICH vessel, temporarily completed with all the closing panels, was performed. Each aerogel tile was inspected and mounted in a pre-selected location of the supporting structure, namely the frontal mirrors for the 2~cm tiles and the upper-frontal closing panel for the 3~cm tiles. The location of each tile was determined in order to concentrate the tiles with the higher expected photon yield at forward polar angles where the particle identification requirements are most demanding. In addition, tiles with close optical properties were coupled in the same location of the double 3~cm layer. The tiles were secured in place by a net of nylon wires which ran along the edges and, on the side, by plastic bumpers covered by a thin foam layer to avoid damages to the aerogel. The tiles were also optically isolated each other by using a thin layer of foam stretched around each tile. In fact, photons produced in one tile and propagating through an adjacent one undergo surface effects that generally degrade the angular resolution. The foam is instrumental to avoid sharp edge contacts between the blocks that might originate cracks in the aerogel material. In addition the foam net bonds together the tiles in forming a sole and stable layer. Fig. \ref{Fig:AeroB1} shows the frontal planar mirror system with the aerogel tiles fully installed.

During the assembling, the aerogel panels were maintained in a low humidity atmosphere (around 20\% relative humidity) to prevent moisture absorption.
Once the assembly of all the tiles was completed, the panels were quickly installed on the RICH vessel, the detector was sealed with all the closing panels and the flow of purged nitrogen was started to minimize the exposure to the external weather conditions.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{aerogel_bottom.pdf}

\label{Fig:AeroB1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Once the detector was sealed and before the transportation to the experimental hall, its functioning parameters were tested for several
weeks in the assembly room. The tests included the two gas systems serving the RICH: the nitrogen system that must keep the internal
humidity at few percent level to preserve the aerogel optical performance and the air cooling system of the readout electronics.

\section{Commissioning of the detector}
%-----------------------------------------------
\label{sec:Commissioning}

The RICH detector was installed in the CLAS12 spectrometer at the beginning of January 2018, in time with the start of the data taking in Hall B.
In preparation of the data taking, a number of tests was routinely performed without and with beam to establish the running conditions and verify the stability of the response.

The basic tool to monitor the RICH Front-End electronics is provided by the measurement of the \MaPMT dark noise counting rate using the self-triggered scaler readout provided by the FPGAs. The number of counts above a programmed threshold is recorded for a time of the order of a second. A fine scan of the threshold value allows to reconstruct the full SPE spectrum of each of the 25 thousands of channels. An example of one SPE spectrum is reported in Fig.\ref{fig:SPEdark}. The main features of the data are: {\it{a)}} a very narrow pedestal where the threshold equals the baseline,  {\it{b)}} a region close to the pedestal where the rate smoothly decreases as the threshold increases (corresponding to the almost linear regime of the MAROC), and  {\it{c)}} a large plateau of the saturation regime, where the count rate is basically insensitive to the threshold setting almost up to the edge of the SPE region.
The plateau is a crucial feature of the Front-End electronics, because it allows a flexible definition of the working point without the need of an extreme precision in the channel equalization. The spectra allows to extract, channel by channel, the pedestal position and width, the dark count rate in the plateau region, and the amplitude of the SPE region. The black and red histograms in Fig. \ref{fig:SPEdark}, taken in April and August 2018 respectively, demonstrate the stability of the readout system over several months of running. Moreover, in Fig. \ref{fig:PedestalMean} the relative variation of the mean pedestal position in the same interval of time is shown. On average, the pedestals are stable at the level of $10^{-3}$.



\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Relative variation of the mean pedestal position of the 25024 readout channels between April and August 2018.}
\label{fig:PedestalMean}
\end{figure}

The pedestal level is different for each readout channel, but it is quite uniform within one MAROC chip, as can be seen from the map shown in Fig. \ref{fig:PedestalMap}. This results guarantee the effectiveness of the common threshold .


\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{PedestalMap.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Map of the mean pedestal position in DAC units (color scale).}
\label{fig:PedestalMap}
\end{figure}

The average count rate in the plateau region provides a measurement of the dark count rate of the channel, as shown in the map in Fig.\ref{fig:DarkCountMap}. The typical dark count rate is few tens of Hz, with more than 99\% of the channels below 100 Hz and only few channels above 10 kHz. It is also found that the highest dark count rates in the MaPMT are located in the first and last row of pixels. Although measured with a completely different setup, these results are in good agreement with the values quoted in the Hamamatsu data sheets.

\begin{center}

\end{center}
\caption{Map of the average dark count rate in the plateau region of threshold values (color scale).}
\label{fig:DarkCountMap}
\end{figure}

The MAROC preamplifier equalization gains are determined using the characterization measurements described in Sect. \ref{sec:FEtests} by tuning the average MaPMT+MAROC gain to $2.7\times 10^6$ in all the channels. The equalization gains range from about 0.5 to 3, with an average value of 1.2.
The effect of the channel-by-channel signal equalization was verified during the engineering run, by taking data at various thresholds for different MAROC gain configurations.  Fig.~\ref{Fig:Equali} shows the ToT distribution for three typical values of the threshold, on the left for all channels without amplification (nominal MAROC gain of 1) and on the right after equalization. After equalization, the ToT distribution of saturated SPE signals is narrower than with unitary gains.  With typical ToT values larger than 40 ns, the signal region is also clearly separated from the cross-talk signals whose ToT values distribute around 25 ns.

After these tests, the common discrimination thresholds were set to +25 DAC units above the average MaPMT pedestal position, a level that corresponds to a small fraction of the average SPE amplitude.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{Figure6.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{ToT distributions of the RICH channels at three typical values of threshold (25, 50 and 100 DAC) without (left) and with (right) gain equalization. The saturated SPE signals generally yield ToT duration greater than 40~ns. When lowering the threshold also weaker cross-talk signals are recorded with ToT duration around 25~ns.}

\section{RICH Slow Control and Interlocks}
%------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:SlowControl}

The RICH slow control is based on Experimental Physics Industrial Control System (EPICS) \cite{Ref:EPICS}. It includes EPICS input-output controllers (IOCs) interfacing with  different types of hardware via  communication protocols and over 25K RICH process variables (PVs).
The controls system monitors  many aspects of the RICH detector, such as scaler rates of all 25K HAMAMATSU MaPMT pixels, FPGA temperatures  of each readout board, HV and LV power supplies, LV and current consumption of each readout unit, gas system, temperature and humidity of the electronic panel volume and detector volume.

For the graphical user interface (GUI) the Systems Studio (CS-Studio), 
%developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
%\cite{Ref:css-website}.   
%CS-Studio is 
an Eclipse-based suite of tools for developing and monitoring large-scale control systems, is used. 
%Fig.~\ref{Fig:RICH_overview} shows the main GUI interface of the RICH slow control. This GUI allows to have direct access to the control of the HV and LV power supply, hardware and software interlocks, as well as to launch the control  of the FPGA temperatures for each readout unit (see Fig.~~\ref{fig:Online_FPGATempMap}) and the average over 64 pixels count rates (in Hz) for each MaPMTs (see Fig.~~\ref{fig:Online_Scalers}).

%\end{figure}

The quality of the data is monitored by scaler and TDC plots. 
Fig. \ref{fig:Online_Scalers} shows the average over MaPMT rate measured by the scaler readout system when the beam is off (top plot) and when the beam is on (bottom plot).
In the top plot, it can be easily identified the few MaPMTs with hot pixels where the dark rate is substantially higher than the average.
The bottom plot shows that when the beam is on the rate is always dominated by physics events. 
Fig.\ref{fig:Online_TDC} shows the occupancy plots from the TDC readout. The top plot shows the occupancy per channel, the center and bottom plots the distributions of the leading and trailing edge times per MaPMT, respectively.
All these plots are used during the data taking to identify possible malfunctioning of one or more channels and eventually solve them through a recovery procedure.
%(see recovery button in Fig:\ref{Fig:RICH_overview}).

%\end{figure}

The slow control and monitoring  of the RICH detector is enforced 
by the hardware interlock system based on the National Instruments CompactRIO (cRIO)  \cite{Ref:cRIO}.
%The cRIO system’s hardware architecture, 
%Fig.~\ref{Fig:cRio_crate}, 
%consists of a chassis, I/O and relay modules, power supply, a reconfigurable FPGA, and an embedded controller, which can be programmed in LabVIEW, C/C++, or Java.  The cRIO GUI interface is presented in Fig.\ref{Fig:RICH_hardware_interlock}.
%A cRIO system obtains signals via hardwired connections to detector sensors and instrumentation, which in turn are hardwired to the detector (red lines). cRIO systems was configured to send process variables to EPICS via Ethernet (black lines), using the standard cRIO/EPICS interface. cRIO systems do not require network connectivity. It is this feature that makes cRIO control, monitoring, and interlock systems invaluable. 

The cRIO system monitors the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Temperature and humidity in 16 locations of the detector volume
\item Temperature and humidity in 16 locations of the electronics panel
\item Air tank pressure 
\item Air and nitrogen flow 
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{RICH_sensors_e_panel.png}
\end{center}
\caption{(Color online) Location of the temperature, humidity and gas flow meters in the electronic panel}
\label{Fig:RICH_sensors_e_panel}
\end{figure}

The locations of the temperature and humidity sensors, air  and nitrogen flow meters inside the electronic panel and nitrogen volume  are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{Fig:RICH_sensors_e_panel} and in 
Fig.~\ref{Fig:RICH_sensors_nitrogen}.

\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{(Color online) Location of the temperature, humidity and gas flow meters in the nitrogen volume.}
\label{Fig:RICH_sensors_nitrogen}
\end{figure}

Signal levels are controlled by setting limits.  If the temperatures, air flow or air pressure are going out of limits the HV and LV is powered off, i.e. interlocked.
In case the humidity or the nitrogen flow are out of limit an alarm signal is generated.

Important safety parameters of the RICH detector are: the temperature of the front end electronics, the nitrogen flow, and the RICH internal relative humidity.
Fig.~\ref{fig:Online_FPGATempMap} presents the map of the temperatures of the front end electronics.
%and Fig.~\ref{fig:Online_EPanelTempStrip} presents the strip charts.
Typical temperature values are around 65$^o$C on the FPGA chips and 40$^o$C in the detector volume.
%The slow control interlock monitors the FPGA temperatures all the time and switches off the HV and LV power supply in case the maximum temperature exceeds the programmable limit (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:RICH_overview}).  
Safety temperature limits are 85$^o$C for the FPGAs, 80$^o$C for the optical fiber cables and 40$^o$C for the temperature on the FTOF detector, which is about 10 cm away from the RICH.
Therefore, the maximum allowed temperature was set to 75$^o$C on the FPGA and to 45$^o$C inside the electronics panel.

The nitrogen flow and the RICH internal relative humidity are measured by several probes installed inside the detector.
%A strip chart of the reported humidity spanning a time interval of several days is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Online_Humidity}.
An alarm is sent out in case the humidity exceeds 5\% or in case the nitrogen flow drops below the normal value. 
In the latter case, the backup system starts working to restore the normal flow level and ensure the safe humidity conditions. During the RICH operation the humidity level was very stable during the time.

\section{RICH Event Reconstruction}
%------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:RICHReco}

The RICH reconstruction is organized in 4 steps.

%In the first step, the spatial and time information of each hit is reconstructed taking into account known spatial misalignment and time calibration corrections. If more than 3 hits are found around a local maximum, they are grouped into a RICH cluster. A cluster is tipically created by a charged particle producing Cherenkov light in the \MaPMT window or ionization in the sensor dynode structure. The time of the cluster is taken to be equal to the time of the local maximum, while its spatial coordinates are calculated as a weighted average over all the hits with their ToT value as weight. If a sole hit is found close to a local maximum, with an amplitude lower than 80\% of that maximum, the hit is flagged as possible cross-talk. The hit should be within a 3x3 \MaPMT pixel matrix (nonet) centered on the maximum, or on a \MAROC input adjacent to the maximum, to be flagged as optical or electrical cross-talk, respectively. This selection rejects about 87\% of the cross-talks, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Xtalk}. A further reduction of the leftover cross-talk contamination, at the level of 2.7\% of the signal, would be only possible with a time versus amplitude analysis, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Spurious}. The cross-talk selection also removes a small 0.8\% fraction of true Cherenkov signals. Those correspond to \MaPMT discharges that undergo incomplete dynode multiplication, while being by chance close in space to an independent Cherenkov signal. Hits flagged as cross-talks are not considered further in the RICH reconstruction.

In the first step, the spatial and time information of each hit in the \MaPMTs is corrected by the spatial misalignment and time calibration parameters. The hits are ordered as a function of their ToT value, as the latter reflects the corresponding amplitude (released charge). A 3x3 \MaPMT pixel matrix centered around a local maximum, i.e. the hit with the highest local ToT, is called a nonet. If more than 3 hits are found in the same nonet they are grouped into a RICH cluster. A cluster is typically created by a charged particle producing Cherenkov light in the \MaPMT window or ionization in the sensor dynode structure. 
%The time of the cluster is taken to be equal to the time of the local maximum, while its spatial coordinates are calculated as a weighted average over all the hits with their ToT value as weight. 
If a sole hit is found close to a local maximum with a ToT lower than 80\% of that maximum, the hit is flagged as possible cross-talk. Hits belonging to the same nonet of the local maximum are flagged as optical cross-talks, while hits readout by an electronic channel adjacent to the one of the maximum in the \MAROC chip are flagged as electrical cross-talks. Note that the readout circuit routing has been designed to connect anodes close in space to non-adjacent MAROC3 inputs. The above selection rejects about 87\% of the cross-talks, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Xtalk}. In the figure the ToT distribution of the recorded RICH hits (black histogram) is shown together with the distributions of the hits identified as optical (magenta dash-dotted) or electrical (green dashed) cross-talk. The shoulders on the right of the cross-talk peaks are likely due to signal discharges wrongly identified as cross-talks. The hits selected for further analysis are highlighted by the dotted blue histogram. The excess at low ToT values indicates a residual contamination of unidentified cross-talks. The leftover cross-talk contamination, at the level of 2.7\% of the signal, can be further reduced only with a time versus amplitude analysis, see Sec~\ref{sec:TimeCalib}. The cross-talk selection also removes a small (0.8\% fraction) of true Cherenkov signals. Those correspond to \MaPMT discharges that undergo incomplete dynode multiplication, while being by chance close in space to a Cherenkov signal. Hits flagged as cross-talks are not considered further in the RICH reconstruction.

\end{figure}

%In the second step, RICH clusters are associated with the CLAS12 tracks if a match in space is found, i.e. the extrapolated impact point of the track into the \MaPMT plane is closer than 10 cm to the cluster center. Matched clusters allow a precise study of the \MaPMT detector position and orientation relative to the CLAS12 tracking system, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:DCmatch}.

The second step consists in finding the spacial match between the RICH clusters and the CLAS12 tracks. This requires that the extrapolated impact point of the track on the \MaPMT plane is within 10 cm of the cluster center. The latter is calculated as a weighted average - with the ToT value as weight - of the spacial coordinates of all the hits in the claster. Matched clusters allow a precise study of the \MaPMT detector position and orientation relative to the CLAS12 tracking system. This is shown in  Fig.~\ref{Fig:DCmatch} where the $\chi^2$ of the distance between the RICH clusters and the matched drift-chamber tracks divided by the pixel spatial rms, is reported. The black distribution is before and the red one after the alignment procedure.

\label{Fig:DCmatch}
\end{figure}

The third step is the core of the RICH reconstruction~\cite{Ref:CLASREC}. For each hit in the MaPMT plane, an estimate of the corresponding Cherenkov angle is derived by ray-tracing the photon path inside the RICH volume taking into account possible reflections. This is done in turn for each charged particle traced trough the RICH, with the photon emission point assumed to be the middle point of the particle path inside the aerogel radiator.

In the forth step a particle identification algorithm is applied using an event-based likelihood of the reconstructed Cherenkov angles and times.

\section{Time calibration and resolution}
%-----------------------------------------------
\label{sec:TimeCalib}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{Tracking_time.png}
\end{center}
%\caption{The photon detection time as measured by the RICH can be compared to the more precise time extrapolated by the CLAS12 spectrometer. The latter is defined as the event start time plus the flight-times of the hadron from the interaction point to the radiator center, and of the ray-traced photon within the RICH volume. Any systematic difference emerging as the average over several events provides a mean of calibration for the RICH time. After calibration, a time coincidence within the event can be used to validate the single photon reconstructed path and emission point.}
\caption{The RICH photon detection time as measured by the  CLAS12 spectrometer. It is defined as the event start time plus the flight-times of the hadron from the interaction point to the radiator center, and of the ray-traced photon within the RICH volume.}
\label{Fig:Traced_Time}
\end{figure}

The time information of the RICH hits is provided by the leading edge time $T_1$ measured by the TDC implemented into the FPGA board with a 1~ns precision. On-time photon hits are selected by comparing their $T_1$ with the time $T_{calc}$ computed using the CLAS12 information (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Traced_Time}). $T_{calc}$ comprises the event start time, the charged track path and flight time provided by the tracking system, and the Cherenkov photon path reconstructed inside the RICH as explained in~\cite{Ref:CLASREC}. 
%Any systematic difference emerging as the average over several events provides a mean of calibration for the RICH time. After calibration, a time coincidence within the event can be used to validate the single photon reconstructed path and emission point.

With respect to the expected time resolution, significant channel-by-channel variations are found in the difference between the measured and the calculated time as it is shown in the top plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Time_uncorr}, where the distributions of $\Delta T=T_1-T_{calc}$ as a function of the channel number is shown. These variations are introduced by the readout chain, with the biggest contribution coming from the average length of the 3 optical fiber trunks and from the specific length of the various fibers in each trunk. Smaller variations among the individual channels of one board can also occur due to the different circuit routing and components. An additional overall time constant is expected from the relative calibration of the RICH with respect to the rest of the CLAS12 detectors.

A broadening of the $\Delta T$ distributions is due to the time walk, i.e. the dependence of the trailing edge time from the amplitude of the input signal. Since the MAROC3 readout is mostly working in the saturated regime already at the SPE level, this effect is expected to be relevant for small amplitude signals, as can be seen from the bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Time_uncorr}. Saturated signals have typical ToT of the order of 60 ns, while small amplitude signal are expected to be discriminated up to several ns later. The vertical band at ToT $\rm \approx 60$ ns comprises a distribution of random-time \MaPMT dark counts and off-time beam bunches. The independent excess around ToT $\rm \approx 25$ ns signals a residual contamination of cross-talk pulses.

\end{center}
\caption{Top plot: distribution of the time difference $\Delta T$ between measured RICH and calculated CLAS12 times as a function of the RICH readout channel. Bottom plot: cumulative distribution of the time difference $\Delta T$ as a function of the hit duration time (ToT).}
\label{fig:Time_uncorr}
\end{figure}

A two step calibration procedure was implemented in order to align the time measured by all the RICH readout channels with the expected (calculated) one. The current version of the software uses electrons and charged pions identified in CLAS12 with momentum bigger than 2.5 GeV/c and Cherenkov photons reconstructed in the RICH with no reflections on the mirrors.

The first step of the procedure consists in the evaluation of the 25024 time offset corrections. The values of $\Delta T$ are plotted for each channel and the position of the maximum is taken as the time offset for that channel. The top plot of Fig.\ref{fig:Toffset} shows a typical $\Delta T$ distribution, with a pronounced peak, a broad tail due to the time walk and a small enhancement above $\approx 10$ ns most likely due to residual cross talk hits. The vertical line indicates the adopted value for the time offset correction.
The bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Toffset} shows a typical map of the time offsets. Three regions of comparable values are highlighted, corresponding to the tiles connected to the 3 optical fiber trunks, on top of smaller channel-by-channel variations.

\begin{figure}[t]

\end{center}
\caption{Top plot: $\Delta T$ distribution for one readout channel; the red line indicate the time offset value. Bottom plot: typical map of the time offsets.}
\label{fig:Toffset}
\end{figure}

Once the individual channels were corrected for the time offsets, the time walk correction were extracted from the $\Delta T$ distribution as a function of ToT. Being the threshold level common to all channels of one MAROC3 chip, and the amplitude equalization performed, one expects that the same time walk correction should work for all the channels of one \MaPMT. This was verified by comparing plots like the one shown in the bottom plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Time_uncorr} for all the channels of the MaPTMs. A set of 391 time walk correction functions, one per MaPMT, is therefore extracted by fitting the dependence of $\Delta T$ as a function of ToT, as shown in the top plot of the Fig.~\ref{Fig:TimeWalk}. The dependence is fitted with two lines, one for the saturated regime and one for the linear region. The free parameters of the fit are the two slopes, the ToT value where the two lines cross, i.e. the saturation ToT, and the $\Delta T$ at zero ToT. The data show small deviations from the linear behaviour, however such a simple functional form was adopted to minimize the probability of fit failure (having to deal with several hundredths of fits) and because was proven to be enough to reach time resolutions meeting the specifications. In the bottom plot of the Fig.~\ref{Fig:TimeWalk}, a typical distribution of the saturation ToT values obtained from the fit is shown. The average value is around 57 ns with small variation from \MaPMT to MaPMT.

\end{center}
\caption{Top plot: fit of the time walk correction for one MaPMT. Bottom plot: distribution of the ToT saturation values extracted from the time walk correction.}
\label{Fig:TimeWalk}
\end{figure}

After calibration, the corrected $\Delta T$ distribution is centered at zero for all the channels, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:DT_corr}. As a consequence, a few ns time coincidence can be applied to remove the spurious hits. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:DT_corr}, the cross-talk hits at ToT $\rm \approx 25$ ns and the 4~ns sub-structure of the off-time beam bunches at ToT $\rm \approx 60$ ns become clearly visible. A typical \dT distribution is shown for one \MaPMT in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ResoTime}, where the red and black histograms show the $\Delta T$ values before and after the correction, respectively. The blue dashed line is a gaussian fit of the corrected distribution.
%The distribution of the $\sigma$ of the gaussian fits of all the channes are shown in the bottom plot of the Fig. \ref{Fig:ResoTimeAll}. 
On average, we obtained a time resolution $<\sigma> \approx$ 0.7 ns, well below the requirement of 1 ns.

\section{RICH Hadron Separation}
%-----------------------------------------------
\label{sec:HadronID}

The RICH has been designed to provide hadron identification in the 3 - 8 GeV/c momentum range. The most challenging separation is between kaons and pions, as their Cherenkov angles become closer and closer with the increase of momentum until a minimum difference of 6 mrad at 8 GeV/c. In addition, in this momentum range the pions yield is more than an order of magnitude larger than other hadron species.

%Various event topologies are possible due to the  unconventional RICH geometry that has to fit in one of the triangular CLAS12 sectors. The hybrid optical configuration requires to work simultaneously with direct photons in proximity focusing and with reflected photons in mirror focusing geometries. In the range of interest for RICH, between 3 GeV/c and 8 GeV/c, electrons can be used as a control sample for pions as their saturated Cherenkov angles are indistinguishable. The large recorded electron statistics allows a detailed optimization of the RICH performance, still ongoing, that should take into account possible misalignments and inhomogeneities of all the optical components.

Various ring imaging topologies are possible due to the  unconventional RICH geometry. These topologies are generated by direct photons in proximity focusing and by reflected photons in mirror focusing geometries. In the momentum range of interest (between 3 GeV/c and 8 GeV/c) electrons can be used for a detailed optimization of the RICH performance since, being in a saturated regime, their Cherenkov angles are indistinguishable from those of pions. The work is still ongoing and make use of the large recorded electron statistics.

Examples of RICH reconstructed events are shown from Fig.~\ref{Fig:Event1} to Fig.~\ref{Fig:Event4} for particle identified as electrons by CLAS12. In each figure, the reconstructed RICH event is displayed on the left. The ray-tracing approach allows, for each particle hypothesis, to anticipate the expected photon pattern and the associated hits on the photodetectors, indicated by small dots in the figures.
%In the presented cases only electrons at the measured momentum are considered (che vuoi dire con "In the presented cases only electrons at the measured momentum are considered"?). The expected photon pattern and the hits associated to the impact point of the electron track are indicated by small dots. 
The measured RICH hits are shown as open circles, whereas reconstructed photon hits are shown as full circles. Direct and reflected photons are indicated in magenta and blue color, respectively. A remarkable feature of the RICH detector is the low level of spurious hits from accidentals, in-time background (i.e. Rayleigh scattering) and dark counts. This feature is crucial for the most challenging cases: particles with high momenta close to the 8 GeV/c limit that require the best resolution in Cherenkov angle, and particles pointing towards the spherical mirror whose number of detected photons is limited by the double reflection and a second passage through the radiator. 

For each event, the details of the time and Cherenkov angle reconstruction are shown on the right. On the top panel, the time coincidence $\Delta T$ between the RICH measured hit and the CLAS12 calculated time is displayed as a function of the photon flight time within the RICH (photon transit time). The time coincidence $\Delta T$ should be close to zero for any true photon path. As a consequence, a valid photon reconstruction is preliminary selected by requiring $\Delta T<3$ ns, indicated by the horizontal dashed lines. The path length is represented by the photon transit time inside the RICH, from the emission point within the aerogel to the detection point in the \MaPMT plane after all the possible reflections. Photons reflected by the spherical mirror and directed back to the aerogel travel twice the gap, with an expected significant increase of path length and a corresponding distinctive $\approx 6$ ns longer transit time. %but with a time coincidence with CLAS12 at the precision level of direct photons

On the bottom panel, the measured angles are compared to the expected distributions for different particle hypotheses. The width of each distribution corresponds to the expected SPE angular resolution, while the average value depends on the particle type and momentum. An acceptance range is defined from the smallest angle expected for a proton to the largest angle expected for an electron, enlarged by three times the expected angular resolution. For the latter, a conservative value of 6 mrad is taken for the single photon case. These limits are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. 
%In the whole 3 GeV/c - 8 GeV/c momentum range relevant for RICH, the Cherenkov cone generated by an electron is saturated to the maximum aperture angle corresponding to the low mass of the particle and a $\rm n \approx 1.05$ refractive index (the exact value depending on the aerogel tile).

\twocolumn

For each reconstructed photon path an estimate of the corresponding Cherenkov angle is obtained and histogrammed on the plot. In all the studied cases, both reflected and direct photon information is consistent with the electron hypothesis. In particular, the reconstructed reflected and direct photon paths with \dT close to zero provide Cherenkov angle values consistent with an electron particle, as expected. The narrow distribution of the measured angle values indicate that kaons can clearly be separated up to momenta greater than 6 GeV/c. Electrons can be distinguished from pions only at low momenta, below 2 GeV/c.

Each aerogel tile presents specific features because the challenging production process, tuned to achieve the highest transparency over a large volume, is not fully industrialized. The most important quality parameters are the density, related to the average refractive index, homogeneity, related to the refractive index variations within the volume, and tile bending, originated by the inner material tension and related to the surface planarity. The effect of these features to the RICH photon reconstruction can be studied in details using the control sample of electrons identified by CLAS12. Given the large number of tiles and the broad range of particle directions after the CLAS12 bending magnets, such a study requires a large statistics and is still ongoing. A similar approach is used for the alignment study. Also in this case, a large statistics is needed due to the numerous involved components (aerogel layers, mirrors and \MaPMT plane) and photon path configurations. 

As a general approach, the RICH performance is studied separately for each aerogel tile, see Fig.~\ref{Fig:Tile}. Despite the above studies have not been finalized yet, and only partial corrections have been implemented so far, the preliminary SPE Cherenkov angle resolution yields about 6 mrad. It is expected to improve towards the goal value of 4.5 mrad once the corrections for the detector misalignment will be implemented and the realistic optical parameters of each aerogel tile will be accounted for. As an example, the effect of a preliminary alignment of the whole RICH detector, not taking into account possible single component misalignments, is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Align}. The RICH global performance estimators are then defined by averaging the results over all the radiator tiles. The preliminary 6 mrad Cherenkov angle resolution is already sufficient for a effective hadron separation in the goal range of momenta, from 3 to 8 GeV/c, as shown by Fig.~\ref{Fig:CHele} and Fig.~\ref{Fig:CHhad}.
