\section{Conclusions}

The SVT is installed in the CLAS12 spectrometer in Hall B of Jefferson Lab, and the performance of modules measured during detector integration has been confirmed. No channels were lost during the installation. The SVT barrel has been electrically  tested with the number of defective channels of 0.1$\%$, well within the specification. The chip average ENC noise is uniform, $\sim$1600 e, in normal operating conditions. There is no evidence of coherent noise between the modules and other components. The tracker has been commissioned with cosmic rays and integrated as part of the CLAS12 central detector. The tracking performance was confirmed with beam data and matches the physics requirements.
