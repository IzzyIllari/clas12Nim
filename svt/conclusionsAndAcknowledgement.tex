We appreciate the contribution of J.  Andresen, C. Britton, S. Chappa, A. Dyer, J. Hoff, V. Re, and T. Zimmerman to the design of the HFCB. We are grateful to administrative, engineering, and technical staff of Fermilab Silicon Detector Facility for excellent work on module assembly.

\section{Conclusions}

The SVT is installed in the CLAS experimental hall, performance of modules measured during detector integration has been confirmed. No channels were lost during the installation. SVT barrel has been electrically  tested with number of defective channels 0.1$\%$, well within the specification. The chip average ENC noise is uniform $\sim$1600 e in normal operating conditions. There is no evidence of coherent noise between the modules and other components. The tracker has been commissioned with cosmic rays and integrated as part of  CLAS central detector. Tracking performance was confirmed with beam data and matches physics requirements.
