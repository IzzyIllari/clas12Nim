\section{Calibration}

Since the SVT modules are designed with a binary readout system, the analog channel response cannot be measured directly. Instead, the analog response is reconstructed by injecting a calibration charge on the channel and measuring the corresponding occupancy over a range of threshold values.

The output signals from the FSSR2 chip can be converted to charge using either internal or external calibration pulses. Because the external pulser can be set to higher frequency than internal pulser without affecting the calibration process, the external pulser circuit was added to the HBCB and the VSCM. Noise is measured using external calibration charge pulses injected at low frequency in the absence of signal. The injected charge is shaped and amplified in the analog circuitry to form an output signal. The voltage at the input of the discriminator is measured over a certain number of triggers. The discriminator threshold determines whether or not the output signal corresponds to a hit. The probability that the injected charge produces a hit depends on the setting of the discriminator threshold. The average hit probability is measured by repeating the process of injecting charges and counting the fraction of readout triggers that produced a hit. This measurement is repeated over a range of threshold settings to produce an occupancy plot. 

The noise occupancy plots are produced by setting the pulser amplitude at fixed values and changing the comparator thresholds. Each point of an occupancy plot for a fixed value of injected charge represents the percentage of times that the comparator fires for a certain value of the threshold settings. In Fig.~\ref{fig:threshold-scan} three occupancy plots taken at different pulser amplitudes for a single channel are presented. The noise occupancy as a function of threshold in case of Gaussian noise is fit by the complementary error function and the probability $p$ of surpassing a threshold $\tau$ is given by Eq. (\ref{eq:erfc}). 

\begin{equation} p(\tau)=\frac{1}{2} erfc(\frac{\tau - \tau_{0}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma})  \label{eq:erfc},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, and $\tau_{0}$ is the mean value, corresponding to the threshold at 50$\%$ occupancy.

In between the high and low threshold regions, the occupancy histogram for each SVT channel is well described by an error function, or S-curve, producing a mean value (discriminator threshold) and standard deviation (noise). The parameters for the mean and $\sigma$ of the $erfc$ fits are shown. The conversion to mV is performed considering the width of one DAC bin (3.5 mV). The injected charge is calculated using the nominal value for the FSSR2 injection capacitance of 40~fF. The threshold at 50$\%$ occupancy is plotted against the input charge, resulting in a response curve, of which the slope is called the gain $G$, measured in mV/fC. The response plot shows the linear dependence of the output pulse height on the input charge in the operation region of the preamplifier. The middle point corresponds to a charge deposited in the sensor by a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP). The slope and the offset parameters of the linear fit are shown. The input noise is obtained by dividing the output noise by the gain using the formula:

\begin{equation} ENC[e^{-}]=6242[e^{-}/fC]\frac{\sigma[mV]}{G[mV/fC]}  \label{eq:enc}
\end{equation}

The threshold charge must be the same across the channels in a detector, otherwise the track-finding algorithms would be biased by the potential extra hits. Any spread in the response among the different channels of a chip results in a spread of the efficiency and noise occupancy that degrades effective performance. This leads to a requirement that the channel-to-channel variations in threshold and noise are kept to a minimum. Threshold dispersion is defined to be the standard deviation of the distribution of means obtained from the parameters of the complementary error function fit. The noise for each individual detector channel is measured and the values are used by the zero-suppression algorithms implemented in the core logic of the FSSR2 and by the calibration procedures to identify defective channels. A comparison of the noise for the 33~cm strips demonstrates that the threshold spread is negligible compared to the noise and does not affect the efficiency and noise occupancy (see Fig.~\ref{fig:thrdisp}). The threshold dispersion agrees with expectations for the FSSR2 chip for the chosen settings.

SVT calibration parameters are stored in the CLAS12 calibration database. The channel calibration table has columns corresponding to sector, layer, chip ID, mean, channel status (good, noisy, open, dead, or masked), ENC, gain, offset, V$_{t50}$ (threshold at 50$\%$ occupancy), and the threshold. There are 21504 rows in the channel calibration table. The ENC and gain are calculated using a calibration amplitude equal to 100 DAC counts (injected charge 4 fC).
The chip calibration table has columns corresponding to layer, sector, chip ID, ENC (electrons), gain (mV/fC), offset (mV), the threshold at 50$\%$ occupancy (V$_{t50}$, mV), threshold dispersion (electrons), chip gain (low, high), BLR mode (off, on), BCO time (ns), shaper time (ns), 8 ADC thresholds in DAC. There are 168 rows in the chip calibration table.
