\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Detector Simulation}

A series of Monte Carlo simulations have been used to calculate the acceptance of the CLAS12 Central Detector
and to study the reconstructed physics parameters for the types of events that are of interest. A realistic model
of the SVT has been developed, describing the location and composition of all modules, with a material description
based on the engineering drawings and assembly procedures, and confirmed by the survey measurements during
integration. The SVT design and module layout were validated by Geant4-based simulated detector performance
studies demonstrating compliance with the technical requirements and engineering models. A 3D view of the
simulated geometry of the SVT sensors is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:svt3dview}. The SVT model is described in
Ref.~\cite{sim-nim}.

\end{figure}

According to the results of the simulation of the SVT, a resolution of 50~$\mu$m in the bending plane is required
in order to measure, with a precision of better than 5\%, tracks with momentum up to 1~GeV (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:PtRes}) \cite{MC1,MC2}. At low momenta the degradation of the resolution is caused by multiple
scattering.

The centroid residual distribution for the simulated muon tracks generated in the interval 0.5--2~GeV is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:centroid-residual-mc}. The cluster centroids were calculated based on the charge-weighting method.
The spatial resolution of the sensors in the transverse plane using the ideal SVT geometry with no misalignments
was found to be about 30~$\mu$m.

\subsection{Backgrounds, Energy Deposition, Dose Rates}
\label{sec:simdetails}

Radiation-induced bulk and surface detector damage studies have been conducted with charged hadrons, leptons,
neutrons, and $\gamma$-ray photons. The damage can be due to ionizing radiation, affecting the surface, and
non-ionizing energy loss from the hadrons interacting with the sensors and introducing lattice defects. The new
energy levels within the band gap lead to an increase of the leakage currents, charge trapping that influences
the charge collection efficiency and depletion voltage, and changes of the effective doping concentration. The
surface damage affects strip isolation and leads to lower position resolution. The bulk damage may occur in
point-like and cluster-like shapes depending on the type and the energy of the particle. Protons and pions are more
likely to introduce point-like defects below a transferred momentum of 5~keV. The lower threshold to produce a
single point defect is $\sim$25~eV~\cite{ROHE}. Neutrons interact only via the strong force, damaging the lattice
and creating isolated cluster defects. The radiation damage produced by different particles with different energies
is scaled under the assumption of the Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) hypothesis as the radiation damage in the
silicon bulk depends only on the non-ionizing energy loss. The damage caused by different particles is referenced to
the damage from 1~MeV neutrons. The standard value for the NIEL of 1~MeV neutrons is 95~MeVmb. This unit is
taken in order to compare different particle energies and interaction mechanisms following the NIEL damage law.

  $z$ axis is along the beamline.}
\label{fig:fluka1}
\end{figure}

To estimate the expected particle fluence and calculate the effects of different target configurations on the SVT
detector,  FLUKA~\cite{FLUKA1, FLUKA2} simulations have been performed. With the help of this tool, the
radiation level in the CLAS12 Central Detector can be visualized. In order to include hadron electro-nuclear
production, a dedicated source term has been used to enhance the physics production from the target, since it is
of key importance in radiation estimates for targets with radiation length below 4$\%$. To assess the radiation
damage to the SVT, the accumulated 1~MeV neutron equivalent fluence has been recorded corresponding to the
planned run conditions. 

\begin{figure}[hbt] 
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{Deuterium_1MeVeq.jpg}
\caption{Accumulated 1~MeV equivalent neutron fluence for a 5-cm-long liquid-deuterium target. $R$ is the radius,
  $z$ axis is along the beamline.}
\label{fig:fluka2}
\end{figure}

For the experiment with the lead target, the expected exposure was 240~hours at a beam current of 38~nA with
an electron beam energy of 6.6~GeV (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fluka1}). For a liquid-deuterium target, the study has been
done for the accumulated charge of 108~mC at 11~GeV (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fluka2}). The target is at the point
$(R,z)=(0, 0)$. The innermost SVT layer is located in $z$ (along the beamline) from -22~cm to 12~cm (the center of
the target is at $z$=0) at a radius $R$=6.5~cm. The maximum fluence on the sensors depends on their position in the
tracker. In both scenarios the expected doses should not cause substantial degradation of the silicon sensors.
Figure~\ref{fig:fluka3} shows the ratio of 1~MeV equivalent neutron fluences for a 5-cm-long liquid-deuterium and
liquid-hydrogen targets. The location of the SVT sensors is indicated by the horizontal lines. The difference in the
estimated fluences comes from the flux of neutrons produced in the liquid-deuterium target. The largest dose is
expected in the intermediate sensors of Region~1.

  targets. $R$ is the radius, $z$ axis is along the beamline.}
\label{fig:fluka3}
\end{figure}

FLUKA simulations of radiation dose have been performed also in terms of high-energy hadron equivalent fluence
that is proportional to the rate of Single Event Effects (SEE)~\cite{FLUKA3}. Hadrons, neutrons, photons and
electrons are implemented depending on their spectra. Figure~\ref{fig:fluka4} shows the accumulated dose for a
liquid-deuterium target in the same conditions. The rate of the SEE should not cause issues with readout electronics.

\end{figure}

Estimated levels of radiation damage in terms of 1~MeV equivalent neutron fluence in silicon in the radial direction
are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:rad-levels-radial} for liquid-hydrogen and carbon targets at nominal beam currents.
Also shown are the radiation levels for the tagger magnet yoke during the beam tuning~\cite{beamline-nim}.

\end{figure}

Geant4-based calculations of fluences, radiation doses, and damage rates in the SVT were performed for
different particles using the CLAS12 Monte Carlo simulation package GEMC~\cite{sim-nim}. The SVT rates were
estimated for liquid-hydrogen, liquid-deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead targets. For each event, 124,000 electrons
going through the target within a 248.5-ns time window were simulated. This corresponds to the full nominal
CLAS12 10$^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ luminosity on a 5-cm-long liquid-hydrogen target at 11~GeV beam energy. Rates
in the first SVT layer for a 5-cm-long liquid-hydrogen target are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rates-lh2}. For a carbon
target at a threshold of 40~keV, the hadronic rate was estimated to be 5~MHz (total rate 40~MHz) with strip hit
rates of 3.1~kHz (Region~1), 2.2~kHz (Region~2), and 1.7~kHz (Region~3). The energy deposited in layer~1 for the
electromagnetic and the hadronic particles is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:energy-deposited-l1}. At a threshold of 30~keV,
92\% of the electromagnetic background is rejected while preserving 99.5\% of the signals coming from the
hadrons~\cite{TDRSVT}.

\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{rates-lh2.jpg}
\caption{Rates in the first SVT layer for a 5-cm-long liquid hydrogen target at the nominal CLAS12 operating
  luminosity of 10$^{35}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.}

\end{figure}

Simulations were performed to optimize the thickness of a tungsten shielding cylinder around the CLAS12
target scattering chamber inside the first SVT layer~\cite{SHIELDNOTE}. A 51-$\mu$m-thick tungsten shield
was ultimately installed based on the results of these studies. The shield consists of 2 sheets mounted over the
top and bottom halves of the foam cylinder referenced to the SVT common ground. The SVT rates and radiation
damage benefit from the inclusion of the tungsten shield. The rates have been compared with beam data at
several beam currents.

\caption{Energy deposited in SVT layer~1 for electromagnetic and hadronic particles for a liquid-hydrogen
  target at the full nominal CLAS12 operating luminosity.}
\label{fig:energy-deposited-l1}
\end{figure}

While the gamma fluences / doses show a dramatic decrease with the introduction of the shielding, the total
fluences and doses decrease significantly for the thinner configuration and do not vary much for thicker tungsten
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:rates-l1}). The photon radiation dose becomes negligible for 50~$\mu$m or more of tungsten
with total 1~MeV equivalent radiation dose about 65~krad per year on a liquid-hydrogen target. For 15 years of
running the experiment on a carbon target the estimated radiation dose for the sensors is 2.5~Mrad (with 50\%
operation)~\cite{TDRSVT}.

\end{figure}

An estimate of the double hit rate from background was performed. Double hits occur when a background hit and
a track hit occur close enough in space to be reconstructed as a cross. Figure~\ref{fig:double-hit-rate} shows the
double hit probability for the inner region of the SVT. The estimated fraction of events with
double hits is 3.8\%. The ratio of the double hits to the single hits was found to be about 1\%.

\subsection{Magnetic Field}

Due to the constraints on the maximum length of the cables, the readout, slow controls, and power supply crates
are installed on a movable service cart within a few meters from the detector. To assess the potential impact of
the solenoid field on the SVT data acquisition, a magnetic field map was simulated for the location of the power
supply and readout crates. Figure~\ref{fig:solenoid-field} shows that the maximum strength of the field at the
crate location is at an acceptable level of 100~G.
