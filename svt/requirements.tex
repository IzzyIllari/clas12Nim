\section{Physics Requirements and Technical Specs}
Essential parts of the CLAS12 physics program, such as the measurement of patron distribution functions, require tracking of low-momentum  particles with a few percent momentum resolution and about one degree angle resolution at large angles \cite{TDR12}. This is achieved by the central tracker, installed inside the CLAS12 5 T superconducting solenoid.
Silicon detector technology provides an excellent match to the central tracking system in the CLAS12 configuration, where small space and high luminosity operation is needed for accurate measurements of exclusive processes at high momentum transfer. The expected integrated luminosity per year in CLAS12 is 500 fb$^{-1}$. The radiation dose for the forward CLAS12 Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) sensors (carbon target) is 2.5~Mrads.

SVT provides tracking capabilities in the central detector region by measuring recoil baryons, large angle pions,  kaons, and protons with tracking efficiency $\ge$ 90$\%$, transverse momentum resolution $\delta$p$_{T}$/p$_{T}$ $\le$ 5$\%$, and angular resolution for polar angles $\delta$$\theta$ $\le$ 10--20 mrad (within 35$^\circ$--125$^\circ$) and azimuthal angles $\delta$$\phi$ $\le5$ mrad (within $\ge$ 90$\%$ of 2$\pi$). Tracks match up with hits in the CLAS12 Central-Time-Of-Flight (CTOF) system for $\beta$ vs. $p$ measurements (particle identification). The SVT allows reconstructing detached vertices, e.g. K$_{s}\!\to\!\pi^{+}\pi^{-},~\Lambda\!\to\!\pi^{-}p,~\Xi\!\to\!\Lambda\pi$, for an efficient experimental program in strangeness physics.

 %\end{itemize}

To satisfy the physics requirements on track momentum resolution, the SVT must have low mass inside the acceptance region. The SVT module position tolerances should be within 20, 500, and 100 $\mu$m across the module, along the module, and along the beam, respectively.
