\section{Physics requirements and technical specs}
Essential parts of the physics program, such as GPDs, require tracking of low momentum  particles with few percent momentum and about one degree angle resolution at large angles \cite{TDR12}. This is achieved by the central tracker.  
Silicon detector technology makes an excellent match to the central tracking system in the CLAS12 configuration, where small space and high luminosity operation is needed for accurate measurements of exclusive processes at high momentum transfer.

SVT provides tracking capabilities in the central detector region by measuring recoil baryons, large angle pions and kaons with tracking efficiency $\ge$ 90$\%$, momentum resolution $\delta$p$_{T}$/p$_{T}$ $\le$ 5$\%$, angular resolution for polar angle $\delta$$\theta$ $\le$ 10--20 mrad (within 35$^\circ$--125$^\circ$), and azimuthal angle $\delta$$\phi$ $\le5$ mrad (within $\ge$ 90$\%$ of 2$\pi$). Tracks match up with hits in the CTOF for $\beta$ vs. p measurement (particle ID). SVT allows reconstructing detached vertices, e.g. K$_{s}\!\to\!\pi^{+}\pi^{-},~\Lambda\!\to\!\pi^{-}p,~\Xi\!\to\!\Lambda\pi$ for efficient experimental program in strangeness physics.

Expected integrated luminosity per year 500 fb$^{-1}$. Radiation dose for forward sensors (carbon target) is 2.5~Mrads.

To satisfy physics requirements on track momentum resolution, SVT should have low mass inside the acceptance region. SVT module position tolerances should be within 20, 500, and 100 $\mu$m across the module, along the module, and along the beam respectively.
