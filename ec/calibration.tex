\section{Calibration} \label{Calibration}

Preliminary energy and timing calibrations of the FEC were performed in preparation for the CLAS12 engineering and initial experimental physics runs in 2017-2018.  Although calibration algorithms were already honed from experience with CLAS, some additional complexity was introduced by the addition of PCAL and the requirements of the FPGA-based physics triggers: 

$\bullet$ Differences in the U,V,W readout geometry of PCAL imposed the need to incorporate light attenuation corrections in the trigger firmware to ensure efficiency and spatial uniformity in the cluster energy reconstruction.

$\bullet$ Trigger efficiency studies and overall physics requirements required well-defined cluster energy thresholds for both electron and MIP triggers in each calorimeter layer (PCAL, ECIN, ECOU).

$\bullet$ Introduction of WLS fibers in the PCAL readout required more accurate time-walk corrections to compensate for the slower scintillator risetimes in the PMT pulse.

\subsection{Energy calibration}
The longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the FEC modules together with the requirement for pattern recognition in the hodoscope design means that cluster reconstruction from the full detector involves a minimum of 9 and up to 25 PMTs.  The total detected energy $E_{det}$ results from the summation:
\begin{equation}
 E_{det} = \sum_{s}^{3} \sum_{v}^{3} \sum_{n}^{N} E_{n}^{sv}\label{eq:E1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 E_{n}^{sv} = k(A_{sig}-A_{ped})/(a+c e^{-xb})   \label{eq:E2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 E_{tot} = E_{det}/f_{s}                 \label{eq:E3}
\end{equation}
where $E_{n}^{sv}$ is the measured energy in the $\it{nth}$ PMT contributing to the peak 
in view $\it{v}$ and stack $\it{s}$, and $\it{k}$ is a conversion from fADC units to MeV.  The summation occurs over the N PMTs in each peak, over the 3 U,V,W views for each stack, and over the PCAL, ECIN and ECOU stacks.  The measured quantities are $\it{A_{sig}}$, the integrated digitized PMT pulse from the fADC and $\it{A_{ped}}$, the fADC pedestal.  The unknown quantities are the constants $a,b,c$ for the parameterization of the light attenuation as a function of the distance $\it{x}$ from the cluster to the readout end of scintillator strip. For EM showers, the detected energy must be corrected by the sampling fraction $f_{s}$, to obtain the total deposited energy $E_{tot}$.  

Since the energy of an electron incident on the FEC is known from forward tracking, energy calibration of the FEC is in principle possible by adjusting the $a,b,c$ parameters and the sampling fraction $f_{s}$ until the reconstructed energy matches the known energy.  However compared to conventional readout geometries, the relationship in the FEC between the total deposited energy $E_{tot}$ and the partial energies $E_{n}^{sv}$ is non-trivial for EM showers.  A global optimization would require fitting hundreds of parameters per sector and might be very slow to converge.

A simpler approach used successfully in CLAS with the EC and demonstrated with the PCAL post-contruction testing described in section \ref{CRT}, is to proceed iteratively, using minimum ionizing particles (MIP) such as cosmic muons to simplify the energy deposition profile and allow an independent determination of the $a,b,c$ parameters for each PMT, then adjust the PMT HV to produce a uniform overall response.  Later, beam data taken with electrons and pions is used to estimate $\it{f_s}$ and to cross-check the MIP calibration.  With the addition of PCAL to CLAS12 and the introduction of cluster reconstruction in the trigger, pre-calibration with cosmics is critical for evaluating the trigger performance of the FEC.

Cosmic runs are performed using a special FPGA trigger that accepts only events where a single pixel has been activated. A pixel is the simplest possible cluster, and is the smallest unit of x-y position resolution in the FEC calorimeters, defined by the overlap of 3 scintillator stacks, one from each of the U,V and W views.  Requiring the muon to pass through a single pixel places the most restrictive cut possible on the particle track path length, thereby minimizing the spread in the MIP energy deposition.

Note in PCAL both V and W strips are readout from the base of the triangle, while ECIN W strips are readout along the right side.

A pixel map of the FEC response to cosmic pixel triggers is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_1_1} for W view strips in PCAL (left) and ECIN (right). The color gradient in both plots clearly shows the attenuation of light as a function of readout distance from the pixel, as well as overall variations in PMT gain near the readout end, such as the substantially brighter strip in ECIN W19.  Also evident is the finer granularity of pixels in PCAL compared to ECIN.  Note also that unlike the ECIN and ECOU calorimeters, which have a constant pixel size, the PCAL pixels have a variable size and shape due to the mixture of single and double readout strip widths and the different number of readout strips in U compared to V and W.

A typical attenuation response plot for a single PCAL PMT (W57) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_1_2} from a cosmic run using a PCAL pixel trigger.  The inset shows the energy loss distribution from a single pixel near the readout end of the scintillator stack and the mean of this distribution for each pixel are the points plotted in the main figure.  The fit shown is used to obtain the $\it{a,b,c}$ calibration constants discussed above.  Using this parameterization the muon MIP peak extrapolated to $x=0$ is $\it{a+c}$.   The desired fADC calibration for this peak corresponds to 10 MeV deposited energy in the 5~cm thick scintillator stack (assuming $dE/dX(mip)=2$~MeV/cm).  PMT high voltages were iteratively adjusted until the peaks were matched within 5\% of the desired calibration.   These gains were then used for the initial round of data taking with an electron beam.

\subsection{Timing calibration}

Optimal timing calibration in the FEC is necessary both for neutral particle ID and background rejection.  Identification of neutrons and photons from neutral clusters (those not matched with a charged particle track from DC) is based solely on time-of-flight from the target.  The hodoscope design of FEC provides considerable redundancy in the measurement of cluster timing, due to the multiplicity of PMTs which contribute to the total cluster energy.  This allows flexibility in the choice of PMTs from which to construct the neutral event time.  In addition this redundancy can be crucial for rejecting accidental clusters formed from randomly overlapping background hits at high luminosity, especially when attempting reconstruction of neutrons. 

Timing calibration of each PMT is based on analysis of clusters in PCAL, ECIN and ECOU arising from electron, pions and photons which span a large range of position and deposited energy.   A $\chi^2$ minimization is performed using six fitted parameters to adjust the difference between the measured time $T_{measured}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:E4}) and the expected readout time $T_{u,v,w}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_2_0}).  Units conversion of the raw TDC measurements and determination of cable delays are absorbed into the $t_{TDC}$ term (Eq.~\ref{eq:E5}).  Corrections due to the amplitude dependence of the discriminated PMT pulse time are parameterized in $t_{ADC}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:E6}) using the integrated pulse from the fADC.  Finally the scintillator effective velocity $v_{eff}$ parameterized in $T_{u,v,w}$ is extracted from fits to $T_{measured}$.  The $t_{TDC}$ and $t_{ADC}$ fits are performed alternately and iterated until convergence is reached.  The $t_{TDC}$ fits are initialized with $a_2, a_3$ and $a_4$ in $t_{ADC}$ set to zero, using a fixed correction of 300(100) for PCAL(ECAL).

\begin{equation}
T_{measured}=t_{TDC}+t_{ADC} \label{eq:E4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
t_{TDC}=a_0+a_1\times~TDC \label{eq:E5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
t_{ADC}=\frac{a_2+300(100)}{ADC^{1/2}}+a_3+\frac{a_4}{ADC^{1/4}} \label{eq:E6}
\end{equation}

The procedure requires knowledge of the event start time $T_{start}$, the pathlength $L$ from the target vertex to the cluster position, together with the readout distances $l_{u,v,w}$ from the cluster as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_2_0}.  These quantities are supplied by the various reconstruction services.  Note that $T_{start}$ is synchronized to the RF pulse containing the incident electron and also compensates for the extended target vertex position.

\caption[]{Cluster readout times $T_{u,v,w}$ at the edges of the calorimeter active area depend on the start time $T_{start}$, track path length $L$ and readout distances $l_{u,v,w}$.  Particles with velocity $\beta\approx 1$ are chosen for calibration, while $v_{eff}$ is extracted from the fits to $T_{measured}$.}
\label{fig:S9_2_0}
\end{figure}

For calibration purposes cluster time is defined by the PMT having the largest ADC value, in order to minimize the time-slew correction and maximize photon statistics.  Typical residual errors in the calibrated cluster times are within 50 ps, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_2_1} for PCAL and ECIN U PMTs in Sector 1.  The vertical red lines show 
the timing resolution averaged over all peak energies visible to that strip.

The deposited energy dependence of the timing resolution for typical strips in PCAL and ECIN is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:S9_2_2}, which clearly shows the improvement in resolution with increasing photon statistics.  Although PCAL has a 3-4 times larger light yield compared to EC, the broader time distribution of photons due to the WLS fiber conversion of light results in somewhat worse resolution compared to EC.  Ultimately the contribution of multiple PMTs from PCAL and EC will be combined to determine the timing of the total energy cluster.
