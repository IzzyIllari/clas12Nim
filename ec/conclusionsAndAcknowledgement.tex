\section{Summary}

We have described the design, assembly, installation, and calibration of six new Pre-Shower Calorimeter (PCAL)
modules for CLAS12. The PCAL modules were built to extend the performance of the CLAS Electromagnetic
Calorimeters (EC) for operation using beam energies up to 12~GeV. Both the PCAL and EC are sampling calorimeters
that utilize a novel triangular hodoscope geometry with a combination of stereo transverse and threefold longitudinal
readout of electromagnetic showers. The PCAL design extends the performance of the EC by increasing the total
radiation length need to fully absorb electron and photon showers.  In addition, the PCAL uses wavelength-shifting
fiber readout to improve both the absolute scintillator light yield and the light attenuation, while the increase in
transverse segmentation improves the spatial resolution by at least a factor of 2. Preliminary analysis of physics runs
with 7.5 and 10.6~GeV electron beams indicate that the combined system of PCAL+EC meets the design goals for
position, energy, and timing resolution, as well as electron trigger efficiency. At present we are still in the early
stages of studying the luminosity and missing mass resolution dependence of the neutron and photon detection
efficiency.
