The CLAS12 forward detector includes six independent lead-scintillator electromagnetic sampling calorimeters to provide the primary electron trigger.  Each calorimeter package consists of an existing CLAS EC module and a new pre-shower calorimeter (PCAL) located in front of the EC to extend the radiation length at 12 GeV.  Both calorimeters use a novel triangular geometry with stereo readout, while the PCAL uses an upgraded design to provide high spatial resolution necessary for reconstructing $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ decays and neutrons with high efficiency.  This paper treats the design, construction and calibration of the PCAL and the combined performance of both detectors.
