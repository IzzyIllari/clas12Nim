  The CLAS12 Forward Detector includes six independent lead-scintillator electromagnetic sampling calorimeters
  to provide the primary electron trigger and extend the CLAS12 detection capability to photons and neutrons. Each calorimeter package consists of two modules, the legacy Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EC) previously used in the CLAS detector, and a new pre-shower calorimeter (PCAL) located in front of the EC to extend the total detector radiation length, in order to fully absorb the electromagnetic showers induced by electrons with energy up to 12 GeV. Both
  calorimeters use a novel triangular hodoscope geometry with stereo readout. The PCAL uses an upgraded
  design to provide high spatial resolution necessary for reconstructing $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ decays and neutrons
  with high efficiency. This paper treats the design, construction, and calibration of the PCAL and the preliminary
  combined performance of both detectors.
