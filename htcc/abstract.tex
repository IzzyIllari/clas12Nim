\begin{abstract}The High Threshold Cerenkov Counter (HTCC) is one of the detector systems of the CLAS12 spectrometer, and is used to generate fast trigger signal in electron experiments. The HTCC is installed in front of the R1 Drift Chambers and introduces a minimal amount of additional material within working acceptance. The HTCC is one unit whose core component is a multifocal mirror that consists of 60 lightweight composite ellipsoidal mirrors. It is important that the HTCC provides efficient coverage of the CLAS12 acceptance with no gaps or overlaps. In order to achieve this, each sector of the CLAS12 spectrometer is covered by 2 identical half-sector mirrors that focuses Cerenkov light on eight phototubes. The HTCC has a total of 48 channels with Electron Tubes 9823QKB PMTs that have a 5" quartz face plate to detect Cerenkov light. The system provides a high rejection of charged $\pi$-mesons and low background noise for reliable identification of scattered electrons. The details of the design, construction, calibration, and performance results of the HTCC are presented in the following paper.
