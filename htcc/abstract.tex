  The High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC) is one of the detector systems of the CLAS12 spectrometer,
  and is used to generate a fast trigger signal in electron scattering experiments. The HTCC is installed in front
  of the drift chambers and introduces a minimal amount of additional material within the acceptance. The HTCC
  is one unit whose core component is a multifocal mirror that consists of 60 light-weight ellipsoidal mirrors. It is
  important that the HTCC provides efficient coverage of the CLAS12 acceptance with no gaps or overlaps. In
  order to achieve this, each sector of the CLAS12 Forward Detector is covered by 2 identical half-sector mirrors
  that focus Cherenkov light on 8 phototubes. The HTCC has a total of 48 channels with Electron Tubes 9823QKB
  PMTs that have a 5-in quartz face plate to detect Cherenkov light. The system provides a high rejection of
  charged $\pi$-mesons and low background noise for reliable identification of scattered electrons. The details of
  the design, construction, calibration, and performance results of the HTCC are presented.
