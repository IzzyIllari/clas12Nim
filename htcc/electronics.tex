\section{Electronics and Light Monitoring System}

\subsection{Electronics}

The electronics of the HTCC provides spectrometric and timing information for electron scattering events that
are detected by the HTCC within its acceptance. Two fast output signals are required from each channel in order
to generate a fast trigger for the CLAS12 spectrometer~\cite{trigger-nim}. This required that the anode signal
from the PMT had to be split or that the voltage divider for the PMT be modified by adding a fast preamplifier to
generate two identical signals with the same polarity. In our case we have chosen to use a modified standard linear
passive high voltage divider that is equipped with a fast preamplifier (see Fig.~\ref{fig:POPOV_1}). This preamplifier
is integrated in the original divider and does not need external power supplies other than the same high voltage
power supply used for the PMTs. The amplification coefficient varies from 8 to 10. The preamplifier provides two
output signals of negative polarity. However, the commissioning of the HTCC has shown that the timing resolution
achieved from the digitized FADC waveform using a standard pulse-shape fitting algorithm is sufficient to avoid the
use of discriminators/TDCs. Therefore the second preamplifier output is not used the HTCC is not used.

    \label{fig:POPOV_1}
\end{figure}

The preamplifier is also fast: the signal rise time increases by 1.5~ns as compared with the signal from a passive
divider, and it is almost as fast as a signal from fast plastic scintillators. Figures~\ref{fig:POPOV_2} and
\ref{fig:POPOV_3} show typical signals provided by a standard passive divider and by the modified divider,
respectively. The pulses have near perfect output termination with no signs of any ringing or after-pulsing.

\end{figure}

The preamplifier is compact and reliable, and does not require any changes in the high voltage power supply or
in the cabling/connection scheme. It consumes relatively low current and does not need additional cooling.
 
It has to be mentioned that the preamplifier we use generates additional noise as any other preamplifier
unavoidably would. However, this additional noise is not an issue due to the much larger noise contribution from
the 5-in PMTs used for the HTCC. These PMTs were so noisy that it was impossible to observe any indication of a
single photoelectron peak. Figure~\ref{fig:POPOV_4} shows the calibration results for a representative PMT
with a modified divider.

      signal (narrow) and a single photoelectron peak. In most cases the PMTs have been used at lower voltage settings
      (by about 600~V) than specified for the standard divider.}

\subsection{Light Monitoring System and Signal Readout}

In order to gain match phototubes that do not directly reveal the single photoelectron signal, we developed a new
external very fast light source with Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Figure~\ref{fig:LMS_Picture_3} shows all
components of the HTCC Light Monitoring System (LMS). The device is remotely driven, allows for changes in the
emitted light intensity, and works at different frequencies in a wide range of these parameters. Once turned on,
and after temperature equilibrium is reached, the source is very stable in providing light signals with the required
strength and timing. There is an LED panel installed at the entry window of a 4-in diameter integrating sphere. This
panel illuminates the sphere and the light is distributed evenly between 50 coated clear optical fibers that are 1~mm
in diameter that form a bundle. All the fibers in the bundle have the same length and direct the light onto the
face of the PMT. The average light intensity is monitored and kept very stable during the entire period of
measurements. The average amplitude was at the level of a few photoelectrons. Since it is possible to adjust the
frequency of the light pulses, we were able to observe PMT signals that were well separated from the dark noise.

    \caption{The Light Monitoring System consists of an integrating sphere (1), fast light source (2), adapter (3),
      50 fiber optic cables bundled in a harness (4), and the reference PMT (5).}
    \label{fig:LMS_Picture_3}
\end{figure} 
 
The valuable features of the LMS and of the procedure for gain matching the phototubes are:
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item The system can be used to calibrate either low-noise or high-noise PMTs;
     \item The LMS generated calibration light intensity was kept stable during data taking;
     \item It is only necessary to have the fiber optics deliver light intensity to all channels with 10-20\% uniformity;
     \item The calibration results are reproducible even if one uses different settings for the LED source;
     \item Maintenance of the LMS is essentially simplified since calibration of the LMS itself is not needed;
     \item Possible usage of the LMS as often as needed without the necessity of providing the same intensity of light
       source in different calibration sessions.
 \end{itemize}

The typical frequency of the LED light pulses is in the range of 6 to 10 kHz and is defined by a standard pulse
generator. The results obtained during the CLAS12 commissioning run and the following physics run with an
electron beam have shown that the information provided by the JLab proprietary FADC250 modules (250~MHz
Flash ADCs)~\cite{daq-nim} for the HTCC signal strength and timing is sufficient.
