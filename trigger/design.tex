\section{Design}

CLAS12 Trigger System is designed as 3-stage pipeline-style system with total latency up to 8us. Stage 1 receives information from various CLAS12 detecrors and performs data processing in according to the type of detector. Stage 2 performs timing and geometry coincidence between different subset of dectors in 6 groups in according to 6-sector CLAS12 detector structure, as well as coincidence with information from central detectors. Stage 3 forms final trigger decision.

\subsection{Stage 1} The most complex processing is performed for electromagnetic calorimeters (cluster finding) and drift chamber tracker (segment and road finding). Stage
