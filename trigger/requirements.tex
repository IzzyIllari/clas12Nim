\section{Requirements}

The CLAS12 detector  has been designed to study the interactions of electrons and photons with nucleons and nuclei at high luminosity. The CLAS12 trigger system have to provide trigger signals for these processes. Based on physics processes simulation required event rate was set to 20 kHz. Trigger latency was required not less then 8 us to provide enough room for trigger logic processing.

%(see Fig.~\ref{fig:CLAS12}). 

Following detectors were defined to be part of the trigger system:

\begin{itemize}
	\item High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC)
	\item Drift Chambers (DC)
	%\item Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC)
	\item Time of Flight System (TOF)
	\item Preshower Calorimeter (PCAL)
	\item Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EC).
	%\item Silicon Vertex Detector (SVT)
	\item Central Time of Flight (CTOF)
	\item Central Neutron Detector (CND)
	\item Forward Tagger (FT)
\end{itemize}

All those detectors were required to provide information to the trigger system. To achieve that front-end electronics was required to be designed with built-in trigger components.
