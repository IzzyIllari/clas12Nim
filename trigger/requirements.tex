\section{Requirements(Sergey,Valery)}

The CLAS12 detector  has been designed to study the interactions of electrons and photons with nucleons and nuclei at high luminosity. 
The CLAS12 trigger system is providing trigger signals for these processes. 
Any detectors with Flash Analog to Digital Converter (FADC) front-end electronics may participate in the trigger event selection.  In addition, track reconstruction by the drift chambers at the trigger level is used to select events with charge particles in the final state. 
%(see Fig.~\ref{fig:CLAS12}). 
The trigger firmware has access to  the following detectors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC)
	\item Drift Chambers (DC)
	\item Low Threshold Cherenkov Counter (LTCC)
	\item Time of Flight System (TOF)
	\item Preshower Calorimeter (PCAL)
	\item Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EC).
	%\item Silicon Vertex Detector (SVT)
	\item Central Time of Flight (CTOF)
	\item Central Neutron Detector (CND)
	\item Forward Tagger (FT)
\end{itemize}
