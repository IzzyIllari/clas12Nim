\section{Acknowledgements}

We are grateful to administrative, engineering, and technical staff of JLab for constant support. CLAS12 Trigger System development was conducted in close cooperation with all CLAS12 detector groups, who contributed into the system design. In particular, we appriciate hard work of the JLab Fast Electronics Group and JLab CODA Group personal. Our special thanks to CLAS12 project leaders Volker Burkert and Latifa Elouadrhiri for leadership and setting goals. This work was supported in part by DOE Contract DE-AC05-84ER40150.

\section{Conclusion}

The work on the CLAS12 Trigger System has started in 2008. The system has been designed and implemented in the years 2008 till 2017. The system has been successfully used during the phaseof development, tests and commissioning of all the CLAS12 detectors. In December 2017, the CLAS12 Trigger System was ready for the first beam experiment. During first year of operation CLAS12 Trigger System was improved taking advantage of its flexible and powerful design, the performance of the various components was improved, and new features were added to increase system efficiency and, most of all, purity. By the end of 2018 system was in full operation mode, allowing to accumulate data with the portion of ``good'' events on the level of higher then 50$\%$. The CLAS12 Trigger System achieved performance allows to use it without significant changes for the entire CLAS12 physics program.
