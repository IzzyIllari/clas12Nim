\section{Conclusion}

The work on the CLAS12 Trigger System started in 2008. The system was designed and implemented from 2008 untill 2017 and has been successfully used during the development, testing and commissioning phases of all CLAS12 detectors. In December 2017, the CLAS12 Trigger System was ready for the first beam experiment. During the first year of operation of CLAS12, the Trigger System was improved to take advantage of its flexible and powerful design, to account for the performance of the various components, and to add new features to increase system efficiency and, most of all, purity. By the end of 2018, the system was in full operation mode, allowing accumulation of data with the portion of ``good'' events on the level of higher than 50$\%$. The achieved performance of the CLAS12 Trigger System allows use without significant changes for the entire CLAS12 physics program.
