\section{Overview}

The CLAS12 Trigger System provides trigger signals for the CLAS12 detector Data Acquisition System (DAQ, \cite{einstein}). Originally it was designed to select physics events with scattered electrons detected in the CLAS12 Electromagnetic Calorimeter System (\ref) and High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC, \ref), with the possibility to require a track in the CLAS12 Drift Chamber (DC, \ref). In later stages of development, signals from additional detectors were included into the Trigger System, making it flexible and efficient to select events for various experiments within the CLAS12 physics program.
