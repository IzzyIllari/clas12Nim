\section{Overview}

CLAS12 Tigger System provides trigger signals for CLAS12 detector Data Aquisition System\cite{einstein}. Originally it was designed to search for electrons using CLAS12 two electromagnetic calorimeters and high threshold cherenkov counter, with possibility to add drift chamber tracker. On later stages of development additional detectors were included into the trigger system making it flexible and powerful machine to select events for various experiments included into CLAS12 physics program.
