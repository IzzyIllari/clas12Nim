\subsection{Drift Chamber-Based Trigger Component and Data-Based Dictionary}

The road dictionary for the Drift Chambers used within the Trigger System was initially generated using the CLAS12 GEMC package as described in Section \ref{simulated_data_preparation}. GEMC uses the geometry and magnetic field obtained by different measurement procedures that have certain accuracy limitations. Since an incomplete road dictionary may cause significant trigger inefficiencies, we decided to generate the road dictionary using data obtained with beam.
