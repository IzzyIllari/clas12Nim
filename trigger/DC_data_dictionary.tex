\subsection{Drift Chamber-based trigger component and data-based dictionary}

Road dictionaly for the drift chamber component of the trigger system was initially generated using GEMC package as it described in section \ref{simulated_data_preparation}. GEMC uses geometry and magnetic field obtained by different measurement procedures which have certain accuracy limitations. Since incomplete road dictionary may cause significant trigger inefficiancy we decided to generate road dictionary using data obtained with beam.
