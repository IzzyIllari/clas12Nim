Another data set was used to create the road dictionary for the Drift Chamber-based trigger component.
For this purpose, positively and negatively tracks were generated uniformly  in a selected momentum, $\theta$,
and $\phi$ range, and tracked through the CLAS12 detector to determine the list of DC wires associated with
the particle trajectory. More details can be found in Section \ref{dc_dictionary}.
