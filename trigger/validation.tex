\section{Validation}

CLAS12 Trigger System Validation was initially performed on data samples simulated by GEANT when system was in design stage. When system was installed cosmic data were used. Finally when beam operation started, validation was compelte and part of entire CLAS12 detector commissioning. Details discussed below.

\subsection{Validation during design phase}

sergey
Validation process consists of several methods and depends on the nature of validated trigger component. For stage1 components written on C++ for HLS/VIVADO implementation,
GEANT-simulated data were processed directly by c++ code and compared with initial similation parameters. 
In addition, the same samples were processed by offline reconstruction software and results compared with the trigger output. 
That double check method practicaly guarantees bug-free implementation. It was no single case when c++ implementation passed validation on
simulated data and failed on final validation stage. Most complicated stage1 components were validated using this method.

Some stage1, as well as all stage2 and stage3 components were implemented using VHDL. For those, VIVADO tools were used for validation diring design phase, in particular ...

\section{Validation of special purpose FPGA triggers using cosmic runs} 

Efficiency and spatial uniformity of cluster finding trigger described in Section 5.3 requires already calibrated calorimeters with pre-determined PMT gain and light attenuation constants loaded into the VTP/FPGA trigger firmware.  Calibration runs using a special purpose MIP trigger were used to obtain these constants.  This so-called "pixel trigger" used a simple multiplicity condition on 1D cluster size for each U,V,W view to reject undesirable muon trajectories and select normally incident tracks.  This reduced the trigger and data rate by 95$\%$ and ensured the same MIP energy was deposited for all possible triple intersections of single strips.  

The pixel trigger pipeline executes these steps in parallel, with user configurable parameters in bold:
  1) If FADC hit energy $>$ \textbf{EMIN}, make a pulse \textbf{HITWIDTH}*4ns for that strip.
  2) Look for coincidence of U,V,W pixel strip candidates from step 1.
  3) Evaluate multiplicity \textbf{EVALDELAY}*4ns clock cycles after the leading edge of a candidate pixel from step 2.
  4) Generate pixel trigger if multiplicity requirement is met and we still have a hit on U,V,and W. 

Additional configurable trigger elements were introduced, including a total energy sum threshold \textbf{ESUM} and a lookup table for triplets of strips which satisfy the geometrical constraint $dU+dV+dW=2.0$, where $d$ is the normalized distance to the hit strip indicated by the arrows in Fig. 6.

\section{Validation for different experiments} Valery

After CLAS12 detector was commissioned and trigger system was validated, we still have to repeat validation process occasionally. It is needed because different experiments requesting configuration changes in trigger system, taking advantage of it's flexibility.
