\section{Performance and Reliability}

The CLAS12 Trigger System operates as a free-running, pipeline-style system run from a global 250~MHz clock. It provides 32 global trigger decisions based on $>$10 different subdetectors ($>$28k channels), which allows for multiple experiments to operate simultaneously. The trigger efficiencies have in general been measured to be about 99\%, indicating a reliable and efficient trigger implementation. The trigger purity has been measured to be about 55\% for electrons (negatives inbending torus polarity configuration), taking advantage of energy-corrected clustering in the EC along with Drift Chamber track matching. It is possible to improve this purity by reducing the timing coincidence windows, jitter, and cell size of the Drift Chamber tracking dictionary. This can be checked by re-analyzing existing event data since it contains the raw waveform data. Not all physics triggers utilize the tracking trigger due to an incomplete road dictionary (e.g. neutral particle decays into charged particles with a detached vertex). Further work to expand the dictionary roads can be investigated to further increase the selection purity.
