\section{Performance and Reliability}

The CLAS12 trigger system opperates as a free-running pipeline-style system run from a global 250MHz clock. It provides 32 global trigger decisions based on ~10 different subdetectors (>28k channels), which allows for multiple experiments to operate simultaneously. Trigger efficiencies have in general been measured high (typically >99\%) indicating a reliable trigger implementation. Trigger purity has been measured ~55\% for electrons (inbending configuration) taking advantage of energy corrected clustering in the EC along with drift chamber track matching. It is possible to improve this purity by reducing the timing coincidence windows, jitter, and cell size of drift chamber tracking dictionary. This can be checked by re-analyzing existing event data since it contains the raw waveform data. Not all physics triggers are utlizing tracking trigger due to the road dictionary not being complete. Further work to expand the dictionary roads can be investigated as this was shown to significantly boost electron selection purity.
